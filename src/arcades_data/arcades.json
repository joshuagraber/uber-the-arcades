    "text": "Translators' ForewordThe materials assembled in Volume 5 of Walter Benjamin's GesammelteSchriflen, under the title Das Passagen-Werk (first published in 1982), repre-sent research that Benjamin carried out, over a period of thirteen years, onthe subject of the Paris arcades-Ies passages-which he considered the mostimportant architectural form of the nineteenth century, and which he linked witha number of phenomena characteristic of that century's major and minor preoc-cupations. A glance at the overview preceding the \"Convolutes\" at the center ofthe work reveals the range of these phenomena, which extend from the literaryand philosophical to the political, economic, and technological, with all sorts ofintermediate relations. Benjamin's intention from the first, it would seem, was tograsp such diverse material under the general category of Urgeschichte, signifyingthe \"primal history\" of the nineteenth century. This was something that could berealized only indirectly, through \"cnnning\": it was not the great men and cele-brated events of traditional historiography but rather the \"refuse\" and \"detritus\"of history, the half-concealed, variegated traces of the daily life of \"the collective;'that was to be the object of study, and with the aid of methods more akin-aboveall, in their dependence on chance-to the methods of the nineteenth-centurycollector of antiquities and curiosities, or indeed to the methods of the nine-teenth-century ragpicker, than to those of the modern historian. Not conceptualanalysis but something like dream interpretation was the model. The nineteenthcentury was the collective dream which we, its heirs, were obliged to reenter, aspatiently and minutely as possible, in order to follow out its ramifications and,finally, awaken from it. This, at any rate, was how it looked at the outset of theproject, which wore a good many faces over time.Begun in 1927 as a planned collaboration for a newspaper article on thearcades, the project had quickly burgeoned under the influence of Surrealism, amovement toward which Benjamin always maintained a pronounced ambiva-lence. Before long, it was an essay he had in mind, \"Pariser Passagen: Einedialektische Feerie\" (paris Arcades: A Dialectical Fairyland), and then, a fewyears later, a book, Paris, die Hauptstadt des XIX. Jahrhunderts (Paris, the Capitalof the Nineteenth Century). For some two-and-a-half years, at the end of theTwenties, having expressed his sense of alienation from contemporary G&lt;:rmanwriters and his affinity with the French cultural milieu, Benjamin worked inter-mittently on reams of notes and sketches, producing one short essay, \"Der"

    "text": "Saturnring oder Etwas vom Eisenbau\" (Ibe Ring of Saturn, or Some Remarkson Iron Construction), which is included here in the section \"Early Drafts:' Ahiatus of about four years ensued, until, in 1934, Benjamin resumed work on thearcades with an eye to \"new and far-reaching sociological perspectives.\" Thescope of the undertaking, the volume of materials collected, was assuming epicproportions, and no less epic was the manifest interminability of the task, whichBenjamin pursued in his usual fearless way-step by step, risking engulfment-beneath the ornamented vaulting of the reading room of the Bibliotheque Na-tionale in Paris. Already in a letter of 1930, he refers to The Arcades Project as \"thetheater of all my struggles and all my ideas:'In 1935, at the request of his colleagues at the Institute of Social Research inNew York, Benjamin drew up an expose, or documentary synopsis, of the mainlines of The Arcades Project; another expose, based largely on the first but moreexclusively theoretical, was written in French, in 1939, in an attempt to interestan American sponsor. Aside from these remarkably concentrated essays, and thebrief text \"The Ring of Saturn;' the entire Arcades complex (without definitivetitle, to be sure) remained in the form of several hundred notes and reflections ofvarying length, which Benjamin revised and grouped in sheafs, or \"convolutes;'according to a host of topics. Additionally, from the late Twenties on, it wouldappear, citations were incorporated into these materials-passages drawn mainlyfrom an array of nineteenth-century sources, but also from the works of keycontemporaries (Marcel Proust, Paul Valery, Louis Aragon, Andre Breton, GeorgSinunel, Ernst Bloch, Siegfried Kracauer, Theodor Adorno). These proliferatingindividual passages, extracted from their original context like collectibles, wereeventually set up to communicate among themselves, often in a rather subterra-nean manner. The organized masses of historical objects-the particular items ofBenjamin's display (drafts and excerpts)-together give rise to \"a world of secretaffinities;' and each separate article in the collection, each entry, was to constitutea \"magic encyclopedia\" of the epoch from which it derived. An image of thatepoch. In the background of this theory of the historical image, constituent of ahistorical \"mirror world;' stands the idea of the monad-an idea given its mostcomprehensive formulation in the pages on origin in the prologue to Benjamin'sbook on German tragic drama, Ursprung des deutschen 11-auerspiels (Origin of theGerman Trauerspiel)-and back of this the doctrine of the reflective medium, inits significance for the object, as expounded in Benjamin's 1919 dissertation,\"Der Begriff der Kunstkritik in der deutschen Romantik\" (Ibe Concept of Criti-cism in German Romanticism). At bottom, a canon of (nonsensuous) similituderules the conception of the Arcades.Was this conception realized? In the text we have before us, is the world ofsecret affinities in any sense perceptible? Can one even speak of a \"world\" in thecase of a literary fragment? For, since the publication of the Passagen- Werk, it hasbecome customary to regard the text which Benjamin himself usually called thePassagenarbeitJ or just the Passagen) as at best a \"torso;' a monumental fragmentor ruin, and at worst a mere notebook, which the author supposedly intended tomine for more extended discursive applications (such as the carefully outlinedand possibly half-completed book on Baudelaire, which he worked on from 1937to 1939). Certainly, the project as a whole is unfinished; Benjamin abandoned"

    "text": "work on it in the spring of 1940, when he was forced to fiee Paris before the ~.advancing German army. Did he leave behind anything more than a large-scaleplan or prospectus? No, it is argued, The Arcades Project is just that: the blueprint t;lfor an unimaginably massive and labyrinthine architecture-a dream city, in ~effect. This argument is predicated on the classic distinction between research rand application, Forschung and Darstellung (see, for example, entry N4a,5 in the _\"Convolutes\"), a distinction which Benjamin himself invokes at times, as in a ~letter to Gershom Scholem of March 3, 1934, where he wonders about ways in ~which his research on the arcades might be put to use, or in a letter of May 3, _1936, where he tells Scholem that not a syllable of the actual text (eigentlichenText) of the Passagenarbeit exists yet. In another of his letters to Scholem of thisperiod, he speaks of the future construction of a literary form for this text. Similarstatements appear in letters to Adorno and others. Where The Arcades Project isconcerned, then, we may distinguish between various stages of research, more orless advanced, but there is no question of a realized work. So runs the lanlent.Nevertheless, questions remain, not least as a consequence of the radical statusof \"study\" in Benjalllin's thinking (see the Kafka essay of 1934, or Convolute mof the Arcades, \"Idleness\"). For one thing, as we have indicated, many of thepassages of reflection in the \"Convolutes\" section represent revisions of earlierdrafts, notes, or letters. Why revise for a notebook? The fact that Benjamin alsotransferred masses of quotations from actual notebooks to the manuscript of theconvolutes, and the elaborate organization of these cited materials in that manu-script (including the use of numerous epigraphs), might likewise bespeak a com-positional principle at work in the project, and not just an advanced stage ofresearch. In fact, the montage form-with its philosophic play of distances, tran-sitions, and intersections, its perpetually shifting contexts and ironic juxtaposi-tions-had become a favorite device in Benjamin's later investigations; anlonghis major works, we have examples of this in Einbahnstrasse (One-Way Street),Berliner Kindheit um Neunzehnhundert (A Berlin Childhood around 1900), \"Uberden Begriff der Geschichte\" (On the Concept of History), and \"Zentralpark\"(Central Park). What is distinctive about The Arcades Project-in Benjamin'smind, it always dwelt apart-is the working of quotations into the framework ofmontage, so much so that they eventually far outnumber the commentaries. Ifwe now were to regard this ostensible patchwork as, de facto, a deterIllinateliterary form, one that has effectively constmcted itself (that is, fragmented it-self), like the Journaux intimes of Baudelaire, then surely there would be sig-nificant repercussions for the direction and tempo of its reading, to say the least.11,e transcendence of the conventional book form would go together, in thiscase, with the blasting apart of pragmatic historicism-grounded, as this alwaysis, on the premise of a continuous and homogeneous temporality. Citation andcommentary might then be perceived as intersecting at a thousand differentangles, setting up vibrations across the epochs of recent history, so as to effect\"the cracking open of natural teleology!' And all this would unfold through themedium of hints or \"blinks\"-a discontinuous presentation deliberately opposedto traditional modes of argument. At any rate, it seems undeniable that despitethe informal, epistolary atmouncements of a \"book\" in the works, an eigentlichenBuch, tile research project had become an end in itself."

    "text": "Of course, many readers will concur with the German editor of the Passagen-Werk, Rolf Tiedemann, when he speaks, in his essay \"Dialectics at a Standstill\"(first published as the introduction to the German edition, and reproduced herein translation), of the \"oppressive chunks of quotations\" filling its pages. Part ofBenjamin's purpose was to document as concretely as possible, and thus lend a\"heightened graphicness\" to, the scene of revolutionary change that was thenineteenth century. At issue was what he called the \"commodification of things;'He was interested in the unsettling effects of incipient high capitalism on the mostintimate areas of life and work-especially as reflected in the work of art (itscomposition, its dissemination, its reception). In this \"projection of the historicalinto the intimate,\" it was a matter not of demonstrating any straightforwardcultural \"decline;' but rather of bringing to light an uncanny sense of crisis and ofsecurity, of crisis in security. Particularly from the perspective of the nineteenth-century domestic interior, which Benjamin likens to the inside of a mollusk'sshell, things were coming to seem more entirely material than ever and, at thesame time, more spectral and estranged. In the society at large (and in Baude-laire's writing par excellence), an unflinching realism was cultivated alongside arhapsodic idealism. This essentially ambiguous situation-one could call it, usingthe term favored by a number of the writers studied in The Arcades Project,\"phantasmagorical\"-sets the tone for Benjamin's deployment of motifs, for hisrecurrent topographies, his mobile cast of characters, his gallery of types. Forexample, these nineteenth-century types (flaneur, collector, and gambler head thelist) generally constitute figures in the middle-that is, figures residing withinas well as outside the marketplace, between the worlds of money and magic-figures on the threshold. Here, furthermore, in the wakening to crisis (crisismasked by habitual complacency), was the link to present-day concerns. Not theleast cunning aspect of this historical awakening-which is, at the same time, anawakening to myth-was the critical role assigned to humor, sometimes humorof an infernal kind. This was one way in which the documentary and the artistic,the sociological and the theological, were to meet head-on.To speak of awakening was to speak of the \"afterlife of works;' somethingbrought to pass through the medium of the \"dialectical image.\" The latter isBenjamin's central term, in The Arcades Project, for the historical object of inter-pretation: that which, under the divinatory gaze of the collector, is taken up intothe collector's own particular time and place, thereby throwing a pointed light onwhat has been. Welcomed into a present moment that seems to be waiting justfor it-\"actualized;' as Benjamin likes to say-the moment from the past comesalive as never before. In this way, the \"now\" is itself experienced as preformed inthe \"then;' as its distillation-thus the leading motif of \"precursors\" in the text.The historical object is reborn as such into a present day capable of receiving it,of suddenly \"recognizing\" it. This is the famous \"now of recognizability\" (Jetztder Erkennbarkeit), which has the character of a lightning flash. In the dusty,cluttered corridors of the arcades, where street and interior are one, historicaltime is broken up into kaleidoscopic distractions and momentary come-ons,myriad displays of ephemera, thresholds for the passage of what Gerard deNerval (in Aurel£a) calls \"the ghosts of material things.\" Here, at a distance fromwhat is normally meant by \"progress;' is the ur-historical, collective redemptionof lost time, of the times embedded in the spaces of things."

    "text": "The German edition of the Passagen- Werk contains-besides the two exposes wehave mentioned, the long series of convolutes that follow, the \"Erste Notizen\"(here translated as \"First Sketches\") and \"Friihe Entwiirfe\" (\"Early Drafts\") at theend-a wealth of supplementary material relating to the genesis of The ArcadesProject. From this textual-critical apparatus, drawn on for the Translators' Notes,we have extracted three additional sets of preliminary drafts and notations andtranslated them in the Addenda; we have also reproduced the introduction by theGerman editor, Rolf Tiedemann, as well as an account of Benjamin's last dayswritten by Lisa Fittko and printed in the original English at the end of theGerman edition. Omitted from our volume are some 100 pages of excerpts fromletters to and from Benjamin, documenting the growth of the project (the major-ity of these letters appear elsewhere in English); a partial bibliography, compiledby Tiedemann, of 850 works cited in the \"Convolutes\"; and, finally, precisedescriptions of Benjamin's manuscripts and manuscript variants (see translators'initial note to the \"Convolutes \"). In an effort to respect the unique constitution ofthese manuscripts, we have adopted Tiedemann's practice of using angle brack-ets to indicate editorial insertions into the text.A salient feature of the German edition of Benjamin's \"Convolutes\"(''Aufzeichnungen und Materialien\") is the use of two different typefaces: a largerone for his reflections in German and a smaller one for his numerous citations inFrench and German. According to Tiedemarm's introduction, the larger type wasused for entries containing siguificant commentary by Benjamin. (In \"FirstSketches;' the two different typefaces are used to demarcate canceled passages.)This typographic distinction, desigued no doubt for the convenience of readers,although it is without textual basis in Benjanrin's manuscript, has been main-tained in the English translation. We have chosen, however, to use typefacesdiffering in style rather than in size, so as to avoid the hierarchical implication ofthe German edition (the privileging of Benjamin's reflections over his citations,and, in general, of German over French). What Benjamin seems to have con-ceived was a dialectical relation-a formal and thematic interfusion of citationand commentary. It is an open, societary relation, as in the protocol to theimaginary world inn (itself an unacknowledged citation from Baudelaire'sParadis artificiels) mentioned in the \"Convolutes\" atJ75,2.As for the bilingual character of the text as a whole, tllls has been, if notentirely eliminated in the English-language edition, then necessarily reduced tomerely the citation of the original titles of Benjanlin's sources. (Previously pub-lished translations of these sources have been used, and duly noted, whereverpossible; where two or more published translations of a passage are available, wehave tried to choose the one best suited to Benjamin's context.) In most cases wehave regularized the citation of year and place of book publication, as well asvolume and issue number of periodicals; bits of information, such as first names,have occasionally been supplied in angle brackets. Otherwise, Benjamin's irregu-lar if relatively scrupulous editorial practices have been preserved.As a further aid to readers, the English-language edition of The Arcades Projectincludes an extensive if not exhaustive \"Guide to Names and Terms)); translators'notes intended to help contextualize Benjanlin's citations and reflections; andcross-references serving to link particular items in the \"First Sketches\" and \"EarlyDrafts\" to corresponding entries in the \"Convolutes:'"

Howard Eilandtranslated Benjanrin's Gennan throughout and was responsible for previouslyuntranslated material in Convolutes D, E, G, I,J, L, M (first half), N, P, and m, aswell as for the Translators' Foreword.In conclusion, a word about the translation of Konvolut. As used for the groupingof the thirty-six alphabetized sections of the Fassagen manuscript, this term, itwould seem, derives not from Benjanrin himself but from his friend Adorno (thisaccording to a communication from Rolf Tiedemann, who studied withAdorno). It was Adorno who first sifted through the manuscript of the \"Aufzeich-nungen und Materialien;' as Tiedemann later called it, after it had been hiddenaway by Georges Bataille in the Bibliotheque Nationale de France during theSecond World War and then retrieved and delivered to New York at the end of1947. In Gennany, the ternl Konvolut has a conmlOn philological application: itrefers to a larger or smaller assemblage-literally, a bundle-of manuscripts orprinted materials that belong together. The noun \"convolute\" in English means\"something of a convoluted fonn:' We have chosen it as the translation of theGerman tenn over a number of other possibilities, the most prominent being\"folder,\" \"file,\" and \"sheaf.\" The problem with these more common Englishterms is that each carries inappropriate connotations, whether of office supplies,computerese, agriculture, or archery. \"Convolute\" is strange, at least on firstacquaintance, but so is Benjanrin's project and its principle of sectioning. Asidefrom its desirable closeness to the German rubric, which, we have suggested, isboth philologically and historically legitimated, it remains the most precise andmost evocative tenn for designating the elaborately intertwined collections of\"notes and materials\" that make up the central division of this most various andcolorful ofBenjatninian texts.The translators are grateful to the National Endowment for the Humanities for atwo-year grant in support of the translation, and to the Dean of the GraduateSchool of Brown University, Peder Estrup, for a generous publication subven-tion. Special thanks are due Michael W Jennings for checking the entire manu-script of the translation and making many valuable suggestions. We are furtherindebted to Wmfried Menninghaus and Susan Bernstein for reading portions ofthe manuscript and offering excellent advice. Rolf Tiedemann kindly andpromptly answered our inquiries concerning specific problems. \"The reviewersenlisted by Harvard University Press to evaluate the translation also providedmuch help with some of the more difficult passages.

Empire is the style of revolutionary terrorism, for which thestate is an end in itself. Just as Napoleon failed to understand the functionalnature of the state as an instrument of domination by the bourgeois class, so thearchitects of his time failed to understand the functional nature of iron, withwhich the constructive principle begins its domination of architecture. Thesearchitects design supports resembling Pompeian columns, and factories that imi-tate residential houses, just as later the first railroad stations will be modeled onchalets. \"Construction plays the role of the subconscious.\"\" Nevertheless, theconcept of engineer, which dates from the revolutionary wars, starts to gainground, and the rivalry begins between builder and decorator, Ecole Polytech-nique and Ecole des Beaux-Arts.For the first tinle in the history of architecture, an artificial building materialappears: iron. It undergoes an evolution whose tempo will accelerate in thecourse of the century. This development enters a decisive new phase when itbecomes clear that the locomotive-on which experiments had been conductedsince the end of the 1820s-is compatible only with iron tracks. The rail be-comes the first prefabricated iron component, the precursor of the girder. Iron isavoided in home construction but used in arcades, exhibition halls, train sta-tions-buildings that serve transitory purposes. At the same tinle, the range ofarchitectural applications for glass expands, although the social prerequisites forits widened application as building material will come to the fore only a hundredyears later. In Scheerbart's Glasarchitektur (1914), it still appears in the context ofutopia.'Each epoch dreams the one to follow.-Michclct, '~venir! Avenir!\"6Corresponding to the form of the new means of production, which in the begin-ning is still ruled by the form of the old (Marx), are inlages in the collectiveconsciousness in which the new is permeated with the old. These inlages are wishinlages; in them the collective seeks both to overcome and to transfigure theimmaturity of the social product and the inadequacies in the social organizationof production. At the same time, what emerges in these wish inlages is theresolute effort to distance oneself from all that is antiquated-which includes,however, the recent past. These tendencies deflect the imagination (which isgiven inlpetus by the new) back upon the prinlal past.

On the other side, artists begin to debate its artistic value. Photogra-phy leads to the extinction of the great profession of portrait miniaturist. Thishappens not just for economic reasons. The early photograph was artisticallysuperior to the miniature portrillt. The technical grounds for this advantage lie inthe long exposure tinle, which requires of a subject the highest concentration; thesocial grounds for it lie in the fact that the first photographers belonged to theavant-garde, from which most of their clientele carne. Nadar's superiority to hiscolleagues is shown by his attempt to take photographs in the Paris sewer system:for d,e first time, dIe lens was deemed capable of making discoveries. Its inlportancebecomes still greater as, in view of the new teclmological and social reality, thesubjective strain in pictorial and graphic infomlation is called into question.The world exhibition of 1855 offers for the first time a special display called\"PhotographY:' In the same year, Wiertz publishes his great article on photogra-phy, in which he defines its task as the philosophical enlightemnent of pillntingYThis \"enlightenment\" is understood, as his own paintings show, in a politicalsense.

With the increasingscope of communications and transport, the informational value of painting di-minishes. In reaction to photography, pillnting begins to stress the elements ofcolor in the picture. By the time Impressionism yields to Cubism, painting hascreated for itself a broader domain into which, for the time being, photographycannot follow. For its part, photography gready extends the sphere of commodityexchange, from mid-century onward, by flooding the market widl couudess im-ages of figures, landscapes, and events which had previously been availableeither not at all or only as pictures for individual customers.

It arises from the wish \"to entertain the working classes,and it becomes for them a festival of emancipation:'l2 The worker occupies theforeground, as customer. The framework of the entertaimnent industry has notyet taken shape; the popular festival provides this. Chaptal's speech on industryopens the 1798 exhibition.- The Saint-Simortians, who envision the industriali-zation of the earth, take up the idea of world exhibitions. Chevalier, thefirst authority in the new field, is a student of Enfantin and editor of the Saint-Simortian newspaper Le Globe. The Saint-Simortians anticipated the developmentof the global economy, but not the class struggle. Next to their active participa-tion in industrial and commercial enterprises around the middle of the centurystands their helplessness on all questions conceming the proletariat.World exhibitions glorify the exchange value of the commodity. They create aframework in which its use value recedes into the background. They open aphantasmagoria which a person enters in order to be distracted. The entertain-ment industry makes this easier by elevating the person to the level of thecommodity. He surrenders to its martipulations while enjoying his alienationfrom himself and others.- The enthronement of the commodity, with its lusterof distraction, is the secret theme of Grandville's art. This is consistent with thesplit between utopian and cynical elements in his work. Its ingenuity in repre-senting inanimate objects corresponds to what Marx calls the \"theological rtice-ties\" of the commodity.\" They are manifest clearly in the specialiti-a category ofgoods which appears at this time in the luxuries industry. Under Grandville'spencil, the whole of nature is transformed into specialties. He presents them inthe same spirit in which the advertisement (the term reclame also originates at thispoint) begins to present its articles. He ends in madness."

Grandville extends the author·ity of fashion to objects of everyday use, as well as to the cosmos. In taking it toan extreme, he reveals its nature. Fashion stands in opposition to the organic. Itcouples the living body to the inorganic world. To the living, it defends the rightsof the corpse. The fetishism that succumbs to the sex appeal of the inorganic is itsvital nerve. The cult of the commodity presses such fetishism into its service.For the Paris world exhibition of 1867, Victor Hugo issues a manifesto: \"To thePeoples of Europe.\" Earlier, and more unequivocally, their interests had beenchampioned by delegations of French workers, of which the first had been sent tothe London world exhibition of 1851 and the second, numbering 750 delegates,to that of 1862.

Tillspoetry is no hymn to the homeland; rather, the gaze of the allegorist, as it falls onthe city, is the gaze of the alienated man. It is the gaze of the lIaneur, whose wayof life still conceals behind a mitigating nimbus the coming desolation of thebig-city dweller. The lIaneur still stands on the threshold-of the metropolis as ofthe middle class. Neither has him in its power yet. In neither is he at home. Heseeks refuge in the crowd. Early contributions to a physiognomies of the crowdare found in Engels and Poe. The crowd is the veil through which the familiarcity beckons to the lIaneur as phantasmagoria-now a landscape, now a room.Both become elements of the department store, which makes use of lIanerie itselfto sell goods.

In this intermediate stage, in which it still haspatrons but is already begirrning to familiarize itself with the market, it appears asthe bohi:me. To the uncertainty of its economic position corresponds the uncer-tainty of its political function.

Their initial field of activity isthe army; later it becomes the petty bourgeoisie, occasionally the proletariat.Nevertheless, this group views the true leaders of the proletariat as its adversary.The Communist Maniftsto brings their political existence to an end. Baudelaire'spoetry draws its strength from the rebellious pathos of this group. He sides withthe asocial. He realizes his only sexual communion with a whore.Easy the way that leads into AvenlUS.-Virgil, Tile Aeneid l7It is the unique provision of Baudelaire's poetry that the image of woman andthe image of death intermingle in a third: that of Paris. -The Paris of his poems isa sunken city, and more submarine than subterranean. The chthonic elements ofthe city-its topographic formations, the old abandoned bed of the Seine-haveevidently found in him a mold. Decisive for Baudelaire in the \"death-fraughtidyll\" of the city, however, is a social, a modem substrate. The modern is aprincipal accent of his poetry. As spleen, it fractures the ideal (\"Spleen et ideal\").But precisely modernity is always citing primal history. Here, this occursthrough the ambiguity peculiar to the social relations and products of thisepoch. Ambiguity is the appearance of dialectic in images, the law of dialectics ata standstill. This standstill is utopia and the dialectical image, therefore, dreamimage. Such an image is afforded by the commodity per se: as fetish.

They are the forerunners of department stores.This is the period of which Balzac writes: \"The great poem of display chants itsstanzas of color from the Church of the Madeleine to the Porte Saint-Denis:' Thearcades are centers of commerce in luxury items. In fitting then1 out, art entersthe service of the merchant. Contemporaries never tire of admiring them. For along time they remain an attraction for tourists.

The phalan-stery is designed to restore human beings to a system of relationships in whichmorality becomes superfluous. Nero, in such a context, would become a moreuseful member of society than Fenelon. Fourier does not dream of relying onvirtue for this; rather, he relies on an efficient functioning of society, whosemotive forces are the passions. In the gearing of the passions, in the complexmeshing of the passions mecanistes with the passion cabaliste, Fourier imagines thecollective psychology as a clockwork mechanism. Fourierist harmony is the nec-essary product of this combinatory play.Fourier introduces into the Empire's world of austere forms an idyll colored bythe style of the 1830s. He devises a system in which the products of his colorfulvision and of his idiosyncratic treatment of numbers blend together. Fourier's\"harmonies\" are in no way akin to a mystique of numbers taken from any othertradition. They are in fact direct outcomes of his own pronouncements-lucubra-tions of his organizational imagination, which was very highly developed. Thus,he foresaw how significant meetings would become to the citizen. For the phalan-stery's inhabitants, the day is organized not around the home but in large hallssimilar to those of the Stock Exchange, where meetings are arranged by brokers.In the arcades, Fourier recognized the architectural canon of the phalanstery.11ris is what distinguishes the \"empire\" character of his utopia, which Fourierhimself naively acknowledges: \"The societarian state will be all the more brilliantat its inception for having been so long deferred.

One of the most remarkable features of dle Fourieristutopia is that it never advocated the exploitation of nature by man, an idea thatbecame widespread in the following period. Instead, in Fourier, technology ap-pears as the spark that ignites the powder of nature. Perhaps this is the key to hisstrange representation of the phalanstery as propagating itself \"by explosion;'The later conception of man's exploitation of nature reHects the actual exploita-tion of man by the owners of the means of production.

Chevalier, thefirst authority in this new field, is a student of Enfantin and editor of the Saint-SinlOnian newspaper Le Globe. The Saint-Simonians anticipated the developmentof the global economy, but not the class struggle. Thus, we see that despite theirparticipation in industrial and commercial enterprises around the middle of thecentury, they were helpless on all questions concerning the proletariat.World exhibitions glorifY the exchange value of the commodity. They create aframework in which its use value becomes secondary. They are a school in whichthe masses, forcibly excluded from consumption, are imbued with the exchangevalue of commodities to the point of identifying with it: \"Do not touch the itemson display.\" World exhibitions thus provide access to a phantasmagoria which aperson enters in order to be distracted. Within these divertissements, to which theindividual abandons himself in the framework of the entertainment industry, heremains always an element of a compact mass. This mass delights in amusementparks-with their roller coasters, their \"twisters;' their \"caterpillars\"-in an atti-tude that is pure reaction. It is thus led to that state of subjection which propa-ganda, industrial as well as political, relies on.-The enthronement of thecommodity, with its glitter of distractions, is the secret theme of Grandville's art.Whence the split between its utopian and cynical elements in his work. Thesubtle artifices with which it represents inanimate objects correspond to whatMarx calls the \"theological niceties\" of the commodity. B The concrete expressionof this is clearly found in the specialite-a category of goods which appears at thistime in the luxuries industry. World exhibitions construct a universe of specialiUs.The fantasies of Grandville achieve the same thing. They modernize the uni-verse. In his work, the ring of Saturn becomes a cast-iron balcony on which theinhabitants of Saturn take the evening all: By the same token, at world exhibi-tions, a balcony of cast-iron would represent the ring of Saturn, and people whoventure out on it would find themselves carried away in a phantasmagoria wherethey seem to have been transformed into inhabitants of Saturn. The literarycounterpart to this graphic utopia is the work of the Fourierist savant TousseneLToussenel was the natural-sciences editor for a popular newspapet: His zoologyclassifies the animal world according to the rule of fashion. He considers womanthe intermediary between man and the animals.

Lows Philippe, or the InteriorII believe ... in my soul: the TIring.-Leon Deubel, Oeuvres (Paris, 1929), p. 193Under the reign of Louis Philippe, the private individual makes his entry intohistory. For the private individual, places of dwelling are for the first time op-posed to places of work. The former come to constitute the interior. Its comple-ment is the office. (For its part, the office is distinguished clearly from the shopcounter, which, with its globes, wall maps, and railings, looks like a relic of thebaroque forms that preceded the rooms in today's residences.) The private indi-vidual, who in the office has to deal with realities, needs the domestic interior tosustain him in his illusions. This necessity is all the more pressing since he has nointention of grafting onto his business interests a clear perception of his socialfunction. In the arrangement of his private surroundings, he suppresses both ofthese concerns. From this derive the phantasmagorias of the interior-which, forthe private individual, represents the universe. In the interior, he brings togetherremote locales and memories of the past. His living room is a box in the theaterof the world.The interior is the asylum where art takes refuge. The collector proves to bethe true resident of the interior. He makes his concern the idealization of objects.To him falls the Sisyphean task of divesting things of their commodity characterby taking possession of them. But he can bestow on them only connoisseurvalue, rather than use value. The collector delights in evoking a world that is notjust distant and long gone but also better-a world in which, to be sure, humanbeings are no better provided with what they need than in the real world, but inwhich things are freed from the drudgery of being useful.IIThe head ...On the night table, like a ranunculus,Rests.-Baudelaire, ~'Une Martyre\"12"

He tries todo this within the four walls of his apartment. It is as if he had made it a point ofhonor not to allow the traces of his everyday objects and accessories to get lost.Indefatigably, he takes the impression of a host of objects; for his slippers and hiswatches, his blankets and his umbrellas, he devises coverlets and cases. He has amarked preference for velour and plush, which preserve the imprint of all con-tact. In the style characteristic of the Second Empire, the apartment becomes asort of cockpit. The traces of its inhabitant are molded into the interior. Here isthe origin of the detective story, which inquires into these traces and follows thesetracks. Poe-with his \"Philosophy of Furniture\" and with his \"new detectives\"-becomes the first physiognomist of the domestic interior.

I ask and seek and have sought for it; I have not found it.-Nietzsche, Also sprach Zarat/wstra 13The liquidation of the interior took place during the last years of the nineteenthcentury, in the work ofJugends til, but it had been coming for a long time. The artof the interior was an art of genre. Jugendstil sounds the death knell of the genre.It rises up against the infatuation of genre in the name of a mal du Jiecie, of aperpetually open-armed aspiration. Jugendstil for the first time takes into consid-eration certain tectonic forms. It also strives to disengage them from their func-tional relations and to present them as natural constants; it strives, in short, tostylize them. The new elements of iron construction-especially the girder-command the attention of this \"modem style!' In the domain of ornamentation,it endeavors to integrate these forms into art. Concrete puts at its disposal newpotentialities for architecture. With van de Velde, the house becomes the plasticexpression of the personality. Ornament is to this house what the signature is to apainting. It exults in speaking a linear, mediumistic language in which the Hower,symbol of vegetal life, insinuates itself into the very lines of construction. (Thecurved line ofJugends til appears at the same time as the tide LeJ FleurJ du mal. Asort of garland marks the passage from the \"Bowers of Evil\" to the \"souls ofHowers\" in Oclilon Redon and on to Swarm's foire catleya.)\"'-Henceforth, asFourier had foreseen, the true framework for the life of the private citizen must besought increasingly in offices and commercial centers. The fictional frameworkfor the individual's life is constituted in the private home. It is thus that TheMaster Builder takes the measure ofJugends til.

WithBaudelaire, Paris becomes for the first time the subject of lyric poetry. TI,ispoetry of place is the opposite of all poetry of the soil. The gaze which theallegorical genius turns on the city betrays, instead, a profound alienation. It isthe gaze of the fl&amp;neur, whose way of life conceals behind a beneficent mirage theanxiety of the future inhabitants of our metropolises. The f1&amp;neur seeks refuge inthe crowd. The crowd is the veil through which the familiar city is transformedfor the flllieur into phantasmagoria. This phantasmagoria, in which the cityappears now as a landscape, now as a room, seems later to have inspired thedecor of department stores, which thus put flllierie to work for profit. In anycase, departnlcnt stores are the last precincts of Banerie.In the person of the flaneur, the intelligentsia becomes acquainted with themarketplace. It surrenders itself to the market, thinking merely to look around;but in fact it is already seeking a buyer. In this intermediate stage, in which it stillhas patrons but is starting to bend to the demands of the market (in the guise ofthe feuilleton), it constitutes the boheme. TI,e uncertainty of its economic positioncorresponds to the anlbiguity of its political function. The latter is manifestespecially clearly in the figures of the professional conspirators, who are recruitedfrom the boheme. Blanqui is the most remarkable representative of this group. Noone else in the nineteenth century had a revolutionary authority comparable tohis. TI,e image of Blanqui passes like a flash of lightning through Baudelaire's\"Litanies de Satan.\" Nevertheless, Baudelaire's rebellion is always that of theasocial fi1an: it is at an impasse.

Baudelairedevelops it with great vigor in \"Les Sept Vieillards:' a poem that deals with theseven-fold apparition of a repulsive-looking old man. This individual, presentedas always the same in his multiplicity, testifies to the anguish of the city dwellerwho is unable to break the magic circle of the type even though he cultivates themost eccentric peculiarities. Baudelaire describes this procession as \"infernal\" inappearance. But the newness for which he was on the lookout all his life consistsin nothing other than this phantasmagoria of what is \"always the same:' (Theevidence one could cite to show that this poem transcribes the reveries of ahashish eater in no way weakens this interpretation.)IIIDeep in the Unknown to find the new!-Baudelaire, \"Le Voyage\"18The key to the allegorical form in Baudelaire is bound up with the specificsignification which the commodity acquires by virtue of its price. The singulardebasement of things through their signification, something characteristic of sev-enteenth-century allegory, corresponds to the singular debasement of thingsthrough their price as commodities. This degradation, to which things are subjectbecause they can be taxed as commodities, is counterbalanced in Baudelaire bythe inestimable value of novelty. La nouveaute represents that absolute which isno longer accessible to any interpretation or comparison. It becomes the ultimateentrenchment of art. The final poem of Les Fleurs du mal: \"Le Voyage:' \"Death,old admiral, up anchor now:'l\" The final voyage of the lImeur: death. Its destina-tion: the new. Newness is a quality independent of the use value of the cormnod-ity. It is the source of that illusion of which fashion is the tireless purveyor. Thefact that art's last line of resistance should coincide with the commodity's mostadvanced line of attack-this had to remain hidden from Baudelaire.\"Spleen et ideal\" -in the title of this first cycle of poems in Les Fleurs du mal,the oldest loanword in the French language was joined to the most recent one.\"For Baudelaire, there is no contradiction between the two concepts. He recog-nizes in spleen the latest transfiguration of the ideal; the ideal seems to him thefirst expression of spleen. With this title, in which the supremely new is presentedto the reader as something \"supremely old:' Baudelaire has given the liveliestform to his concept of the modern.

In Paris, speculation is at its height. Haussmann's expropria-tions give rise to speculation that borders on fraud. The rulings of the Court ofCassation, which are inspired by the bourgeois and Orleanist opposition, in-crease the financial risks of Haussmannization. Haussmann tries to shore up hisdictatorship by placing Paris under an emergency regime. In 1864, in a speechbefore the National Assembly, he vents his hatred of the rootless urban popula-tion. This population grows ever larger as a result of his projects. Rising rentsdrive the proletariat into the suburbs. The quartiers of Paris in this way lose theirdistinctive physiognomy. The \"red belt\" forms. Haussmann gave himself the titleof \"demolition artist.\" He believed he had a vocation for his work, and empha-sizes this in his memoirs. The central marketplace passes for Haussmann's mostsuccessful construction-and this is an interesting symptom. It has been said ofthe lie de la Cite, the cradle of the city, that in the wake of Haussmann ouly onechurch, one public building, and one barracks remained. Hugo and Merimeesuggest how much the transformations made by Haussmann appear to Parisiansas a monument of Napoleonic despotism. The inhabitants of the city nO longerfeel at home there; they start to become conscious of the inhuman character ofthe metropolis. Maxime Du Camp's monumental work Paris owes its existenceto this dawning awareness. The etchings of Meryon (around 1850) constitute thedeath mask of old Paris.The true goal of Haussmann's projects was to secure the city against civil war.He wanted to make the erection of barricades in the streets of Paris impossiblefor all time. With the same end in mind, Louis Philippe had already introducedwooden paving. Nevertheless, barricades had played a considerable role in theFebruary Revolution. Engels studied the tactics of barricade fighting. Haussmannseeks to forestall such combat in two ways. Widening the streets will make theerection of barricades impossible, and new streets will connect the barracks instraight lines with the workers' districts. Contemporaries christened the opera-tion \"strategic embellishment.\""

This ideal corresponds to the tendency-common inthe nineteenth century-to ennoble technological necessities through spuriousartistic ends. The temples of the bourgeoisie's spiritual and secular power were tofind their apotheosis within the framework of these long streets. The perspec-tives, prior to their inauguration, were screened with canvas draperies and un-veiled like monuments; the view would then disclose a church, a h'ain station, anequestrian statue, or some other symbol of civilization. With the Haussmanniza-tion of Paris, the phantasmagoria was rendered in stone. Though intended to en-dure in quasi-perpetuity, it also reveals its brittleness.

Itdispels the illusion that the task of the proletarian revolution is to complete thework of '89 in close collaboration with the bourgeoisie. This illusion had markedthe period 1831-1871, from the Lyons riots to the Commune. The bourgeoisienever shared in this error.

Itwas there that he wrote his L'Elernite par les aslres [Eternity via the Stars]. Thisbook completes the century's constellation of phantasmagorias with one last,cosmic phantasmagoria which implicitly comprehends the severest critique of alIthe others. The ingenuous reflections of an autodidact, which form the principalportion of this work, open the way to merciless speculations that give the lie tothe author's revolutionary elan. The conception of the universe which Blanquidevelops in this book, taking his basic premises from the mechanistic naturalsciences, proves to be a vision of hell. It is, moreover, the complement of thatsociety which Blanqui, near the end of his life, was forced to admit had defeatedhim. The irony of this scheme-an irony which doubtless escaped the authorhimself-is that the terrible indictment he pronounces against society takes theform of an unqualified submission to its results. Blanqui's book presents the ideaof eternal return ten years before Zaralhuslra-in a manner scarcely less movingthan that of Nietzsche, and with an extreme hallucinatory power.This power is anything but triumphant; it leaves, on the contrary, a feeling ofoppression. Blanqui here strives to trace an image of progress that (immemorialantiquity parading as up-to-date novelty) tums out to be the phantasmagoria ofhistory itself. Here is the essential passage:The entire universe is composed of astral systems. To create them, nature has only ahundred simple bodies at its disposal. Despite the great advantage it derives fromthese resources, and the innumerable combinations that these resources afford itsfecundity, the result is necessarily ajinite number, like that of the elements them-selves; and in order to fill its expanse, nature must repeat to infinity each of itsoriginal combinations or types. So each heavenly body, whatever it might be, exists ininfinite number in time and space, not only in one of its aspects but as it is at eachsecond of its existence, from birth to death .... The earth is one of these heavenlybodies.

They are by no means phantoms; they are the present eternalized.Here, nonetheless, lies a great drawback: there is no progress . ... What we call\"progress\" is confined to each particular world, and vanishes with it. Always andeverywhere in the terrestrial arena, the same drama, the same setting, on the samenarrow stage-a noisy humanity infatuated with its own grandeur, believing itself tobe the universe and living in its prison as though in some immense reahn, only tofounder at an early date along with its globe, which has borne with deepest disdainthe burden of human arrogance. \"The same monotony, the same immobility, onother heavenly bodies. The universe repeats itself endlessly and paws the ground inplace. In infinity, eternity performs-imperturbably-the same routines. 23This resignation without hope is the last word of the great revolutionary. Thecentury was incapable of responding to the new technological possibilities with anew social order. That is why the last word was left to the errant negotiatorsbetween old and new who are at the heart of these phantasmagorias. The worlddominated by its phantasmagorias-this, to make use of Baudelaire's term, is\"modernity.\" Blanqui's vision has the entire universe entering the modernity ofwhich Baudelaire's seven old men are the heralds. In the end, Blanqui viewsnovelty as an attribute of all that is under sentence of danmation. Likewise in Gietet e'!fir [Heaven and Hell], a vaudeville piece that slightly predates the book: inthis piece the torments of hell figure as the latest novelty of all time, as \"painseternal and always new!'

What else can this mean but that topography is the ground plan of thismythic space of tradition &lt;Traditiomraum&gt;, as it is of every such space, and that itcan become indeed its key-just as it was the key to Greece for Pausanias, andjust as the history and situation of the Paris arcades are to become the key for theunderworld of this century, into which Paris has sunk.

Our waking existence likewise is a land which, at certain hidden points,leads down into the underworld-a land full of inconspicuous places from whichdreams arise. All day long, suspecting nothing, we pass them by, but no soonerhas sleep come than we are eagerly groping our way back to lose ourselves in thedark corridors. By day, the labyrinth of urban dwellings resembles conscious-ness; the arcades (which are galleries leading into the city's past) issue unre-marked onto the streets. At night, however, under the tenebrous mass of thehouses, their denser darkness protrudes like a threat, and the nocturnal pedes-trian hurries past-unless, that is, we have emboldened him to tum into thenarrow lane.But another system of galleries runs underground through Paris: the Metro,where at dusk glowing red lights point the way into the underworld of names.Combat, Elysee, Georges V; Etienne Marcel, Solferino, Invalides, Vaugirard-they have all thrown off the humiliating fetters of street or square, and here in thelightning-scored, whistle-resounding darkness are transformed into misshapensewer gods, catacomb fairies. This labyrinth harbors in its interior not one but adozen blind raging bulls, into whose jaws not one Theban virgin once a year butthousands of anemic young dressmakers and drowsy clerks every morning musthurl themselves. 0 Street Names DHere, underground, nothing more of the colli-sion, the intersection, of names-that which aboveground forms tile linguisticnetwork of the city. Here each name dwells alone; hell is its demesne. Amer,Picon, Dubonnet are guardians of the threshold. [Cla,2]\"\"Doesn't every quartie1' have its true apogee some time before it is fully built up?At that point its planet describes a curve as it draws near businesses, first the largeand then the small. So long as the street is still somewhat new~ it belongs to thecommon people; it gets clear of'them only when it is smiled on by fashion. Withoutnaming prices, the interested parties dispute among themselves for the rights tothe small houses and the apartments, but only so long as the beautiful women, theones with the radiant elegance that adorns not only the salon but the whole houseand even the street, continue to hold their receptions. And should the lady becomea pedestrian, she will want some shops, and often the street must pay not a little foracceding too quickly to this wish. Courtyards are made smaller, and many areentirely done away with; the houses draw closer together. In the end, there comesa New Year's Day when it is considered bad form to have such an address on one~svisiting card. By then the majority of tenants are businesses only, and the gatewaysof the neighborhood no longer have much to lose if now and again they furnishasylum for one of the small tradespeople whose miserahle stalls have replaced theshops. \" &lt;Charles) Lefeuve, Les Anciennes Maisons de Paris sous Napoleon III(Paris and Brussels, 1873), vol. 1, p. 482:' 0 Fashion D [Cla,3]"

I refer to the excellent publication by Taride, with its twenty-twomaps of all the Parisian arrondissements and the parks ofBoulogne and Vmcennes.Whoever has stood on a streetcorner of a strange city in bad weather and had todeal with one of those large paper maps-which at every gust swell up like a sail,rip at the edges, and soon are no more than a little heap of dirty colored scrapswith which one torments oneself as with the pieces of a puzzle-learns from thestudy of the Plan Taride what a city map can be.

[Cla,4]Paris is built over a system of caverns from which the din of Metro and railroadmounts to the surface, and in which every passing omnibus or truck sets up aprolonged echo. And this great technological system of tunnels and thorough-fares interconnects with the ancient vaults, the limestone quarries, the grottoesand catacombs which, since the early Middle Ages, have time and again beenreentered and traversed. Even today, for the price of two francs, one can buy aticket of admission to this most nocturnal Paris, so much less expensive and lesshazardous than the Paris of the upper world. The Middle Ages saw it differently.Sources tell us that there were clever persons who now and again, after exactinga considerable sum and a vow of silence, undertook to guide their fellow citizensunderground and show them the Devil in his infernal majesty. A financial ven-ture far less risky for the swindled than for the swindlers: Must not the churchhave considered a spurious manifestation of the Devil as tantamount to blas-phemy? In other ways, too, this subterranean city had its uses, for those whoknew their way around it. Its streets cut through the great customs barrier withwhich the Farnlers General had secured their right to receive duties on inlports,and in the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries smuggling operations went on forthe most part below ground. We know also that in times of public commotionmysterious rumors traveled very quickly via the catacombs, to say nothing of theprophetic spirits and fortunetellers duly qualified to pronounce upon them.

Paris is the breeding ground of his mythology-Paris with itstwo or three great bankers (Nucingen, du TIllet), Paris with its great physicianHorace Bianchon, with its entrepreneur Cesar Birotteau, with its four or fivegreat cocottes, with its usurer Gobseck, with its sundry advocates and soldiers.But above all-and we see this again and again-it is from the same streets andcorners, the same little rooms and recesses, that the figures of this world step intothe light. What else can this mean but that topography is the ground plan of thismythic space of tradition &lt;Traditiomraum&gt;, as it is of every such space, and that itcan become indeed its key-just as it was the key to Greece for Pausanias, andjust as the history and situation of the Paris arcades are to become the key for theunderworld of this century, into which Paris has sunk.

Our waking existence likewise is a land which, at certain hidden points,leads down into the underworld-a land full of inconspicuous places from whichdreams arise. All day long, suspecting nothing, we pass them by, but no soonerhas sleep come than we are eagerly groping our way back to lose ourselves in thedark corridors. By day, the labyrinth of urban dwellings resembles conscious-ness; the arcades (which are galleries leading into the city's past) issue unre-marked onto the streets. At night, however, under the tenebrous mass of thehouses, their denser darkness protrudes like a threat, and the nocturnal pedes-trian hurries past-unless, that is, we have emboldened him to turn into thenarrow lane.But another system of galleries runs underground through Paris: the Metro,where at dusk glowing red lights point the way into the underworld of names.Combat, Elysee, Georges V, Etienne Marcel, Solferino, Invalides, Vaugirard-they have all thrown off the humiliating fetters of street or square, and here in thelightning-scored, whistle-resounding darkness are transfornled into misshapensewer gods, catacomb fairies. This labyrinth harbors in its interior not one but adozen blind raging bulls, into whose jaws not one Theban virgin once a year butthousands of anemic young dressmakers and drowsy clerks every morning musthurl themselves. 0 Street Names 0 Here, underground, nothing more of the colli-sion, the intersection, of names-that which aboveground forms the linguisticnetwork of the city. Here each name dwells alone; hell is its demesne. Amer,Picon, Duboilllet are guardians of the threshold. [Cla,2]~'Doesn 't every quartier have its true apogee some time before it is fully built up?At that point its planet describes a curve as it draws near businesses, first the largeand then the small. So long as the street is still somewhat new, it belongs to thecommon people; it gets clear of them only when it is smiled on by fashion. Withoutnaming prices, the interested parties dispute among themselves for the rights tothe small houses and the apartments, hut only so long as the beautiful women, theones with the radiant elegance that adorns not only the salon but the whole houseand even the street, continue to hold their receptions. And should the lady becomea pedestrian, she will want some shops, and often the street must pay not a little foracceding too quickly to this wish. Courtyards are made smaller, and many areentirely done away with; the houses draw closer together. In the end, there comesa New Year's Day when it is considered bad form to have such an address on one'svisiting card. By then the majority of tenants are businesses only, and the gatewaysof the neighhorhood no longer have much to lose if now and again they furnishasylum for one of the small tradespeople whose miserable stalls have replaced theshops.\" &lt;Charles&gt; Lefeuve, Les Anciennes Maisons de Paris sous Napoleon III(Paris and Brussels, 1873), vol. 1, p. 482:'0 Fashion 0 [Cla,3]"

It showed the back of a woman in white who was thicklywrapped in a shawl and who, in all haste, had just reached the top of a flight ofstairs, where, her head half turned ,md a finger upon her lips, she is ever soslightly opening a heavy door, through which one glimpses the starry sky. In thisway Wilkie Collins advertised his latest book, one of the greatest detective novelsever written: The Woman in White. See Tahneyr, La Cilif du sang (Paris, 1901),pp.263-264. [Gl,6]It is significant that Jugendstil failed in interior design, and soon afterward inarchitecture too, whereas in the street, with the poster, it often found very suc-cessful solutions. This is fully confirmed in Behne's discerning critique: \"By nomeans was Jugendstil ridiculous in its original intentions. It was looking forrenewal because it clearly recognized the peculiar contradictions arising betweenimitation Renaissance art and new methods of production deternlined by themachine.

The genuine liberation from an epoch, that is,has the structure of awakening in this respect as well: it is entirely mled bycunning.

The same thought with which the bourgeoishere detects the tendency of advertising in its early period: \"In short, the moral ofthe poster has nothing to do with its art, and its art nothing to do with the moral,and this defines the character of the poster\" (ibid., p. 275). [G1,8]Just as certain modes of presentation-genre scenes and the like-begin, in thecourse of the nineteenth century, to \"cross over)) into advertising, so also into therealm of the obscene. The Nazarene style and the Makart style have their blackand their colored lithographic cousins in the field of obscene graphics. I saw aplate that, at first glance, could have passed as something like Siegfried's bath indragon blood: green sylvan solitude, crimson mantle of the hero, naked flesh, asheet of water-it was the most complicated embrace of tllTee human bodies, andit looked like the frontispiece of an inexpensive book for young people. Ths isthe language of color characteristic of the posters that flourished in the arcades.When we hear that portraits of famous cancan dancers like Rigolette andFrichette would have hung there, we have to imagine them colored like this.Falser colors are possible in the arcades; that combs are red and green surprisesno one. Snow White's stepmother had such things, and when the comb did notdo its work, the beantiful apple was there to help out-half red, half poison-green, like cheap combs. Everywhere gloves playa starring role, colored ones,but above all the long black variety on which so many, following YVette Guilbert,have placed their hopes for happiness, and which will bring some, let us hope, toMargo Lion. And laid out on a side table in a tavern, stockings make for anethereal meat counter. [G 1a, 1]The writings of the Surrealists treat words like trade names, and their texts are, atbottom, a form of prospectus for enterprises not yet off the ground. Nestingtoday in trade names are figments such as those earlier thought to be hidden inthe cache of \"poetic\" vocables. [G1a,2]In 1867, a wallpaper dealer put up his posters on the columns ofhridges. [Gla,3]Many years ago, on the streetcar, I saw a poster that, if things had their due in thisworld, would have found its admirers, historians, exegetes, and copyists just assurely as any great poem or painting.

There I traveled on a colorless Sunday afternoon inthat northern Moabit, a part of town that had already once appeared to me asthough built by ghostly hands for just this time of day.

In the background of thedesert landscape, two posts held a large sigo with the words \"Is the Best.\" Butwhat about the trace of salt down the desert trail? It formed letters, and theseletters formed a word, the word \"Bullrich Salt:' Was not the preestablishedharmony of a Leibniz mere child's play compared to this tightly orchestratedpredestination in the desert?

The ent.husiasmthat, in 1851, was felt in the most disparate circles has subsided, and in its placehas come a kind of cool calculation. In 1851, we were living in the era of freetrade .... For some decades now, we have witnessed the spread of protection-ism .... Participation in the exhibition becomes ... a sort of representation ... ;and whereas in 1850 the ruling tenet was that the government need not concernitself in this affair, the situation today is so far advanced that the government ofeach country can be considered a veritable entrepreneur.\" Julius Lessing, Dashalbe Jahrhundert der Weltausstellungen (Berlin, 1900), pp. 29-30.

[GSa,6]\"From the same sphere of thought that engendered the great idea of free tradearose ... the notion that no one would come away empty-handed-rather, thecontrary-from an exhibition at which he had staked his best so as to be able totake home the best that other people had to offer.... This bold conception, inwhich the idea for the exhibition originated, was put into action. Within eightmonths, everything was finished. 'An absolute wonder that has become a part ofhistory.' At the foundation of the entire undertaking, remarkably enough, reststhe principle that such a work must be backed not by the state but by the freeactivity of its citizens .... Originally, two private contractors, the Munday broth-ers, offered to build, at their own risk, a palace costing a million marks. Butgrander proportions were resolved on, and the necessary funds for guaranteeingthe enterprise, totaling many millions, were subscribed in short order. The greatnew thought found a great new form. The engineer Paxton built the Crystal Pal-ace. In every land rang out the news of something fabulous and unprecedented: apalace of glass and iron was going to be built, one that would cover eighteen acres.Not long before this, Paxton had constructed a vaulted roof of glass and iron forone of the greenhouses at Kew, in which luxuriant palms were growing, and thisachievement gave him the courage to take on the new task. Chosen as a site for theexhibition was the finest park in London, Hyde Park, which offered in the middlea wide open meadow, traversed along its shorter axis by an avenue of splendidelms. But anxious onlookers soon raised a cry of alarm lest these trees be sacrificedfor the sake of a whim. 'Then I shall roof over the trees,' was Paxton's answer, andhe proceeded to design the transept, which, with its semicylindrical vault elevated112 feet above the ground, ... accommodated the whole row of elms.

    "text": "decisive impetus, within this period as a whole, for the revolution in artistic forms.To build a palace out of glass and iron seemed to the world, in those days, afantastic inspiration for a temporary piece of architecture. We see now that it wasthe first great advance on the road to a wholly new world of forms .... The con-structive style, as opposed to the historical style, has become the watchword of themodern movement. When did this idea make its triumphal entry into the world? Inthe year 1851, with the Crystal Palace in London. At first, people thought it impos-sible that a palace of colossal proportions could be built from glass and iron. In thepublications of the day, we find the idea of assembling iron components, so famil-iar to us now, represented as something extraordinary. England can boast of hav-ing accomplished this quite novel task in the space of eight months, using itsexisting factories, without any additional capacity. One points out triumphantlythat ... in the sixteenth century a small glazed window was still a luxury item,whereas today a building covering eighteen acres can be constructed entirely outof glass. To a manlike Lothar Bucher, the meaning of this new structure was clear:it was the undisguised architectural expression of the transverse strength of slen-der iron components. But the fantastic charm which the edifice exerted on all soulswent well beyond such a characterization, however crucial for the program of thefutul'e; and in this regard, the preservation of the magnificent row of trees for thecentral transept was of capital importance. Into this space were transported all thehorticultural glories which the rich conservatol'ies of England had been able tocultivate. Lightly plumed palms from the tropics mingled with the leafy crowns ofthe five-hundred-year-old elms; and within this enchanted forest the decoratorsarranged masterpieces of plastic art, statuary, large bronzes, and specimens ofother artworks. At the center stood an imposing crystal fountain. To the right andto the left ran galleries in which visitors passed from one national exhibit to theother. Overall, it seemed a wonderland, appealing more to the imagination than tothe intellect. 'It is with sober economy of phrase that I term the prospect incompa-rably fairy-like. This space is a summer night's dream in the midnight sun'(Lothar Bncher). Such sentiments were registered throughout the world. I myselfrecall, from my childhood, how the news of the Crystal Palace reached us inGermany, and how pictures of it were hung in the middle-class parlors of distantprovincial towns. It seemed then that the world we knew from old fairy tales-ofthe princess in the glass coffin, of queens and elves dwelling in crystal houses-hadcome to life ... , and these impressions have persisted through the decades. Thegreat transept of the palace and part of the pavilions were transferred to Syden-ham, where the building stands today;!! there I saw it in 1862, with feelings of aweand the sheerest delight. It has taken four decades, numerous fires, and manydepredations to ruin this magic, although even today it is still not completelyvanished.\" Julius Lessing, Das halbe ]ahrhundert der 'Weltausstellungen (Berlin,1900), pp. 6-10.

Both the rope and thecord describe parabolic or elliptical curves. Why so? Why, at such an early age,tlus preference of the minor sex for the elliptical curve, this manifest contempt formarbles, ball, and top? Because the ellipse is the curve oflove, as the circle is thatof friendship.

[H2,6]One may start from the fact that the true collector detaches the object from itsfunctional relations. But that is hardly an exhaustive description of this remark-able mode of behavior. For isn't this the foundation (to speak with Kant andSchopenhauer) of that \"disinterested\" contemplation by virtue of which the col-lector attains to an unequaled view of the object-a view which takes in more,and other, than that of the profane owner and which we would do best tocompare to d,e gaze of the gteat physiognomist? But how his eye comes to reston the object is a matter elucidated much more sharply through another consid-eration. It must be kept in mind that, for the collector, the world is present, andindeed ordered, in each of his objects. Ordered, however, according to a surpris-ing and, for the profane understanding, incomprehensible c011llection. 11ris con-nection stands to the customary ordering and schematization of things somethingas their alTangement in the dictionary stands to a natural arrangement. We needonly recall what importance a particular collector attaches not only to his objectbut also to its entire past, whedler this concerns the origin and objective charac-teristics of the thing or the details of its ostensibly external history: previousowners, price of purchase, current value, and so on. All of these-the \"objective\"data together with the other-come togethel; for the true collector, in everysingle one of his possessions, to form a whole magic encyclopedia, a world order,whose outline is the fite of his object. Here, therefore, within this circumscribedfield, we can understand how gteat physiognomists (and collectors are physiog-nOnUsts of the world of things) become interpreters of fate. It suffices to observejust one collector as he handles the items in his showcase. No sooner does hehold them in his hand than he appears inspired by them and seems to lookthrough them into their distance, like an augur.

[J47,2]Toward the end of the Second Empire, as the regime relaxes its pressure, thetheory of l'art pour l'art suffers a loss in prestige. [J47,3]From the argument of the Guys essay, it would appear that Baudelaire's fascina-tion with this artist was connected above all with his handling of backgrounds,which differs little from the handling of backgrounds in the theater. But becausethese pictures, unlike scenery on a stage, are to be viewed from close up, themagic of distance is canceled for the viewer without his having to renouncethe judgment of distance. In the essay on Guys, Baudelaire has characterized thegaze which here and in other places he himself turns toward the distance.

(There are not many artistswhose work attests so little to a development as that of Baudelarre.) Thesepositions represent theoretical extremes, of which the dialectical mediation isgiven by Baudelaire's whole oeuvre, without being entirely present to his con-scious reflection. The mediation resides in the destructive and purificatory char-acter of the work. This art is useful insofar as it destroys. Its destructive fury isdirected not least at the fetishistic conception of art. Thus it serves \"pure\" art, iuthe sense of a purified art. [J49,1]The first poems of Les Fleurs du mal are all devoted to the figure of the poet. Fromthem it emerges, precisely insofar as the poet makes appeal to a station and atask, that society no longer has such things to confer. [J49,2]An examination of those places where the \"1\" appears in the poems of Baudelairemight result in a possible classificatory grouping. In the first five poems of LesFleurs du mal, it surfaces but a single time. And further on, it is not unusual tofind poems in which the \"1\" does not occur. More essential-and, at the sametime, more deliberate-is the way in other poems, like \"Reversibilite\" or \"Har~monie du soir;' it is kept in the background.

    "text": "The figure of the lesbian woman belongs among Baudelaire's heroic exemplars.[He himself gives expression to this in the language of his satanism. It would beno less comprehensible in an unmetaphysical critical language.] The nineteenthcentury began opeuly and without reserve to include the woman in the processof commodity production. The theoreticians were united in their opinion thather specific femininity was thereby endangered; masculine traits must necessarilymanifest themselves in women after a while. Baudelaire affirms these traits. Atthe same time, however, he seeks to free them from the domination of theeconomy. Hence the purely sexual accent which he comes to give this develop-mental tendency in woman. The paradigm of the lesbian woman bespeaks theambivalent position of \"modernity\" vis-it-vis technological development. (Whathe could not forgive in George Sand, presumably, was her having profaned,through her humanitarian convictions, this image whose traits she bore. Baude-laire says that she was worse than Sade.)266 [J49a,1]The concept of exclusive rights was not so widely accepted in Baudelaire's day asit is today. Baudelaire often republished his poems two or three times withouthaving anyone take offense. He ran into difficulties with this only toward the endof his life, with the Petits Poemes en prose. [J49a,2]From his seventeenth year, Baudelaire led the life of a &lt;litterateur?&gt;. One cannotsay that he ever thought of himself as an \"intellectual\" or engaged himself onbehalf of \"the life of the mind.\" The registered trademark for artistic productionhad not yet been invented. (In this situation, moreover, his imperious need todistinguish himself and withdraw worked to his advantage.) He refused to goalong with the defamation of the bourgeois, under the banner of which there wasmobilized a solidarity of artists and men of !etters that he considered suspect.Thus, in the \"Musee classique du Bazar Bonne~Nouvellen &lt;Classical Museum ofthe Good·News Bazaar&gt; (Oeuvres, vol. 2, p. 61), he writes: \"The bourgeois, whohas few scientific notions, goes where the loud voice of the bourgeois artistdirects him.-If this voice were suppressed, the grocer would carry E. Delacroixaround in triumph. The grocer is a great thing, a divine being whom it is neces-sary to respect, homo bonae valuntatis!,,267 In more detail a year earlier, in thepreface to the \"Salon de 1845.\" [J49a,3]Baudelaire's eccentric individuality was a mask under which he tried to con-ceal-out of shame, you could say-the supra-individual necessity of his way oflife and, to a certain extent, his life history.

[Not so much the prophetic one: for he gave no thoughtto any sort of reform.] From this intention sprang his violence, his inlpatience,and his anger; from it, too, sprang the ever-renewed attempts to cut the world tothe heart [or sing it to sleep]. In this intention he provided death with an accom-paniment: his encouragement of its work. [JSO,2]"

[J5Ia,7]In the \"Salon de 1846\" (Oeuvres, vol. 2, p. 134), Baudelaire has described hissocial class through the clothes they wear.

It was not given hinl to find a refuge in devotions, likeVerlaine, nor to heighten the youtluul vigor of his lyric elan through the betrayalof his adulthood, like Rimbaud. As rich as Baudelaire is in knowledge of his craft,he is relatively unprovided with stratagems to face the times. And even tl,e grandtragic part he had composed for the arena of his day-the role of the \"mod-ern\" -could be filled in the end only by himself. All this Baudelaire no doubtrecognized. The eccentricities in which he took such pleasure were those of themime who has to perform before a public incapable of following the action on thestage-a mime, furthermore, who knows this about his audience and, in hisperformance, allows tl,at knowledge its rightful due.

This was manifest at the moment the security of theconditions oflife was considerably diminished through an accelerated successionof crises. The idea of etenJa.i recurrence derived its luster from the fact that it wasno longer possible, in all circumstances, to expect a recurrence of conditionsacross any interval of time shorter than that provided by eternity. The quotidianconstellations very gradually began to be less quotidian. Very gradually theirrecurrence became a little less frequent, and there could arise, in consequence,the obscure presentiment that henceforth one I11USt rest content with cosmicconstellations.

Around the middle of the century, the bourgeois class ceases tobe occupied with the future of the productive forces it has unleashed.

In order to concern itselffurther with the future of the productive forces which it had set going, thebourgeoisie would first of all have had to renounce the idea of private income.That the habit of \"coziness\" so typical of bourgeois comfort around midcenturygoes together with this lassitude of the bourgeois imagination, that it is one withthe luxury of \"never having to think about how the forces of production mustdevelop in their hands\"-these things admit of very little doubt. The dream ofhaving children is merely a beggarly stimulus when it is not imbued with thedream of a new nature of tlrings in which these children might one day live, or forwhich they can struggle. Even the dream of a \"better hmnanity\" in which ourchildren would \"have a better life\" is only a sentimental fantasy reminiscent ofSpitzweg when it is not, at bottom, the dream of a better nature in which theywould live. (Herein lies the inextinguishable claim of the Fourierist utopia, aclaim which Marx had recognized [and which Russia had begun to act on].) Thelatter dream is the living source of the biological energy of humanity, whereas theformer is only the muddy pond from which the stork draws children.

In Baudelaire, one encounters merelytraces of a sinlliar perception-though a good many traces. In few of his poems,however, is the metropolis portrayed so exclusively in terms of what it makes ofits inhabitants as in \"Spleen !:' This poem shows in a veiled way how the soullessmasses of the big city and the hopelessly depleted existence of individuals cometo complement one another. The first is represented by the cemetery and thesuburbs-mass assemblages of citizens; the second, by the jack of hearts and thequeen of spades. [J69,2]The hopeless decrepitude of ti,e big city is felt particularly keenly in the firststanza of \"Spleen 1:' [J69,3]In ti,e opening poem of Les Fleurs du mal, Baudelaire accosts the public in a mostunusual fashion.

In this regard, the last poem of the\"Spleen et ideal\" sequence corresponds exactly to the sequence \"La Mort!'[J69,S]The poem \"J.]Horloge\" &lt;The Clock&gt; takes the allegorical treatment quite far.Grouped about the clock, which occupies a special position in the hierarchy ofemblems, are Pleasure, the Now, Time, Chance, Virtue, and Repentance.

She has even intensified its powerof delusion insofar as, in commerce with her, an always fictive pleasure arises,one that is supposed to corresond to the pleasure of her partner. In other words,the capacity for pleasure itself now figures as a value in dUs commerce-as theobject of an exploitation perpetrated no less by her than by her partner. On theother hand, one sees here the distorted, more than life-size mage of an availabil-ity that holds for everyone and is discouraged by none.

The \"beyond\" of the choicegoverning relations between mother and child, and the here and now of thechoice governing relations between prostitute and client, make contact at a singlepoint. This point defines the situation of Baudelaire's libido. (Compare X2,1:Marx on prostitution.) [J75a]The lines from \"Selige Sehnsucht\"-\"No distance can weigh you dowu, / Youcome flying, fascinated\"424-describe the experience of the aura. The distance thatis there in the eyes of the beloved and that draws the lover after it is the dream ofa better nature. The decline of the aura and the waning of the dream of a betternature-this latter conditioned on its defensive position in the class struggle-areone and the same. It follows that the decline of the aura and the decline of sexualpotency are also, at bottom, one.

[J77a,5]It can be seen from the portraits that Baudelaire's physiognomy very earlyshowed the marks of old age. Among other things, this accounts for the oft-notedresemblance between his features and those of prelates. [J77a,6]Valles was perhaps the first to complain insistently (as Souday would do later)about Baudelaire's \"backwardness\" (J21,6). [J77a,7]Allegory recognizes many enigmas, but it knows no mystery. An enigma is afragment that, together with another, matching fragment, makes up a whole.Mystery, on the other hand, was invoked from time inuuemorial in the image ofthe veil, which is an old accomplice of distance. Distance appears veiled. Now,the painting of the Baroque-unlike that of the Renaissance, for example-hasnothing at all to do with this veil. Indeed, it ostentatiously rends the veil and, asits ceiling frescoes in particular demonstrate, brings even the distance of the skiesinto a nearness, one that seeks to startle and confound. This suggests that thedegree of auratic saturation of human perception has fluctuated widely in thecourse of history. (In the Baroque, one might say, the conflict between cult valueand exhibition value was variously played out within the confines of sacred artitself.) While these fluctuations await further clarification, the supposition arisesthat epochs which tend toward allegorical expression will have experienced acrisis of the aura.

In manufacture, the isolation of each detailprocess is a condition imposed by the nature of division of labor, but in the fullydeveloped factory the continuity of those processes is, on the contrary, impera-tive.\" .\"\" Here may be found the key to the Baroque procedure whereby meaningsare conferred on the set of fragments, on the pieces into which not so much thewhole as the process of its production has disintegrated. Baroque emblems maybe conceived as half-finished products which, from the phases of a productionprocessl have been converted into monuments to the process of destruction.During the Tbirty Years' War, which, now at one point and now at another,inll110bilized production, the \"intenuption\" that, according to Marx, charac-terizes each particular stage of this labor process could be protracted almostindefinitely. But the real triumph of the Baroque emblematic, the chief exhibit ofwhich becomes the death's head, is the integration of man himself into theoperation. The death's head of Baroque allegory is a half-finished product ofthe history of salvation, that process interrupted-so far as this is given him torealize-by Satan. [J78,4]The financial ruin of Baudelaire is the consequence of a quixotic struggle againstthe circumstances that, in his day, detennined consumption. Ine individual con-sumer, who vis-a.-vis the artisan commissions work, figures in the marketplace ascustomer. There he does his part in the clearance of a stock of commoditieswhich his particular wishes have had no influence whatsoever in producing.Baudelaire wanted to have such particular wishes reflected not only in his choiceof clothing-the tailor's was, of all the branches of business, the one that had toreckon longest with the consumer who conunissions work-but also in his furni-ture and in other objects of his daily use. He thus became dependent on anantiquary who was less than honest, and who procured for him paintings andantique furniture that in some cases proved to be fakes. The debts which heincurred through these dealings weighed on hun for the rest of his life. [J78a,l]In the final analysis, the image of' petrified unrest called up by allegory is ahistorical image. It shows the forces of antiquity and of Christianity suddenlyarrested in their contest, turned to stone amid unallayed hostilities. In his poemon the sick muse, with its masterful verse that hetrays nothing of the chimericalnature of the poet's wish, Baudelaire has devised, as ideal image of the muse'shealth, what is really a formula for her distress: \"I'd wish ... / Your Christianblood to flow in waves that scan / With varied sounds of ancient syllables;'434[J78a,2]"

It is this grasp that is missing in Baudelaire. This grasp, whichmakes palpable the distance of the modem poet from allegory, is precisely whatenables allegory to incorporate into itself the most immediate realities. With whatdirectness that can happen is best shown by Shelley's poem, in which bailiffs,parliamentarians, stockjobbers, and many other types figure. The allegory, in itsemphatically antique character, gives them all a sure footing, such as, for exam·pIe, the businessmen in Baudelaire's \"Crepuscule du soir\" do not have.-Shelleyrules over the allegory, whereas Baudelaire is ruled by it.

In manufacture the isolation of each detail process is a condition imposedby the nature of division of labor, but in the fully developed factory the continu-ity of those processes is, ou the contrary, imperative:' Karl Marx, Das Kapital,vol. 1 (Hamburg, 1922), p. 344.\" [K3,2]Film: unfolding &lt;result?,\" of all the forms of perception, the tempos and rhythms,which lie preformed in today's machines, such that alI problems of contemporaryart find their definitive formulation only in the context of film. 0 Precursors 0[K3,3]A small piece of materialist analysis, more valuable than most of what exists inthis field: \"We love these hard, solid blocks of material which F1aubert raises andlets fall with the intermittent thud of a steam shovel.

It is an ambiguity consider-ably heightened by the intensification of capital management-as we see exem-plified quite clearly in the machines which aggravate exploitation rather thanalleviate the human lot. Isn't there implicit here a general connection to theequivocalness of the phenomena we are dealing with in the nineteenth century?The significance of intoxication for perception, of fiction for thinking, such aswas never before recognized? \"One thing has disappeared in the general up-heaval, and it was a great loss for art: the naive and therefore dependable accordoflife and appearance\"-so we read, characteristically, inJulius Meyer's Geschichteder modernen.franziisischen Malerei seit 1789 (Leipzig, 1867), p. 31. [K3,5]On the political significance of film. Socialism would never have entered theworld if its proponents had sought only to excite the enthusiasm of the workingclasses for a better order of things. What made for the power and authority of themovernent was that Marx understood how to interest the workers in a socialorder which would both benefit them and appear to them as just. It is exactly thesame with art. At no point in time, no matter how utopian, will anyone win thenlasses over to a higher art; they can be won over only to one nearer to them.And the difficulty consists precisely in finding a form for art such that, with thebest conscience in the world, One could hold that it is a higher art. This will neverhappen with most of what is propagated by the avant-garde of the bourgeoisie.Here, Berl's argument is perfectly correct: \"The confusion over the word 'revolu-tion' -a word which, for a Leninist, signifies the acquisition of power by theproletariat, and which elsewhere signifies ti,e overturning of recognized spiritualvalues-is sufficiently attested by the Surrealists in their desire to establish Pi-casso as a revolutionary.... Picasso deceives them .... A painter is not morerevolutionary for having 'revolutionized' painting than a tailor like Poiret is forhaving 'revolutionized' fashion, or than a doctor is for having 'revolutionized'medicine;' Emmanuel Ber!, \"Prernier pamphlet;' Europe, 75 (1929), p. 401. Themasses positively require from the work of art (which, for them, has its place inthe circle of consumer items) something that is warming. Here the flame mostreadily kindled is that of hatred. Its heat, however, burns or sears without provid-ing the \"heart's ease\" which qualifies art for consumption. Kitsch, on the otherhand, is nothing more than art with a 100 percent, absolute and instantaneousavailability for consumption. Precisely within the consecrated forms of expres-sion, therefore, kitsch and art stand irreconcilably opposed. But for developing,living forms, what matters is that they have witllin them something stirring,useful, ultinlately hearteillng-that they take \"kitsch\" dialectically up into them-selves, and hence bring themselves near to the masses while yet surmounting thekitsch. Today, perhaps, film alone is equal to this task-or, at any rate, more readyfor it than any otl,er art form. And whoever has recogrlized this will be inclined"

Chabrillat is friends with a certain bohemien, a gifted draftsman, whoat the time is homeless. This man has an idea. Among the waxworks in this mu-seum is one group representing the visit of Empress Eugenie to cholera patients inAmiens. At the right, the empress smiles on the patients; to the left is a Sister ofCharity in white cornet; and lying on an iron cot, pale and emaciated beneath thefine clean bedclothes, is a dying man. The museum closes at midnight. The drafts-man opines: Nothing simpler than to remove, with due care, the cholera patient,lay him on the floor, and take his place in the bed. Chabrillat gives his permission;the wax figures mean little to him.

Our man wants nothing to do with the myriad possibilitiesoffered to sate his appetite. Like an ascetic arrimal, he flits through unknowndistricts-until, utterly exhausted, he stumbles into his room, which receives himcoldly and wears a strange air. [Ml,3JParis created the type of the flaneur. What is remarkable is that it wasn't Rome.And the reason? Does not dreanring itself take the high road in Rome? And isn'tthat city too full of temples, enclosed squares, national shrines, to be able to entertout entiere-with every cobblestone, every shop sign, every step, and every gate-way-into the passerby's dreanl? The national character of the Italians may alsohave much to do with this. For it is not the foreigners but they themselves, theParisians, who have made Paris the promised land of the flilneur-the \"landscapebuilt of sheer life;' as Hofmannsthal once put it. Landscape-that, in fact, is whatParis becomes for the flaneur. Or, more precisely: the city splits for him into itsdialectical poles. It opens up to him as a landscape, even as it closes around himas a room. [Ml,4JThat ananmestic intoxication in which the flaneur goes about the city not onlyfeeds on the sensory data taking shape before his eyes but often possesses itself ofabstract knowledge-indeed, of dead facts-as something experienced and livedthrough. This felt knowledge travels from one person to another, especially byword of mouth. But in the course of the nineteenth century, it was also depositedin an inunense literature. Even before Lefeuve, who described Paris \"street bystreet, house by house;' there were numerous works that depicted this storiedlandscape as backdrop for the dreaming idler. The study of these books consti-ruted a second existence, already wholly predisposed toward dreaming; andwhat the flilneur learned from them took form and fignre during an afternoonwalk before the aperitif. Wouldn't he, then, have necessarily felt the steep slopebehind the church of Notre Dame de Lorette rise all the more insistently underhis soles if he realized: here, at one time, after Paris had gotten its first omnibuses,the cheval de renflrt was harnessed to the coach to reinforce the two other horses.[Ml,5JOne must make an effort to grasp the altogether fascinating moral constitution ofthe passionate flilneur. The police-who here, as on so many of the subjects weare treating, appear as experts-provide the following indication in the report ofa Paris secret agent from October 1798(?): \"It is almost inlpossible to summonand maintain good moral character in a thickly massed population where eachindividual, unbeknownst to all the others, hides in the crowd, so to speak, andblushes before the eyes of no one:' Cited in Adolf Schmidt, Pariser Zustiindewiihrend der Revolution, vol. 3 (Jena, 1876).

[Nla,6]This research-which deals fundamentally with the expressive character of theearliest industrial products, the earliest industrial architecture, the earliest ma-chines, but also the earliest departnlent stores, advertisenlents, and so on-thusbecomes important for Marxism in two ways. First, it will demonstrate how themilieu in which Marx's doctrine arose affected that doctrine through its expres-sive character (which is to say, not only through causal connections); but, second,it will also show in what respects Marxism, too, shares the expressive character ofthe material products contemporary with it. [Nla,7]Method of this project: literary montage. I needn't say anything. Merely show. Ishall purloin no valuables, appropriate no ingenious formulations. But the rags,the refuse-these I will not inventory but allow, in the only way possible, to comeinto their own: by making use of them. [Nla,8]Bear in mind that commentary on a reality (for it is a question here of commen-tary, of interpretation in detail) calls for a method completely different from thatrequired by commentary on a text. In the one case, the scientific mainstay istheology; in the other case, philology. [N2,1]It may be considered one of the methodological objectives of this work to demon-strate a historical materialism which has annihilated within itself the idea ofprogress. Just here, historical materialism has every reason to distinguish itselfsharply from bourgeois habits of thought. Its founding concept is not progressbut actualization. [N2,2]Historical \"understanding\" is to be grasped, in principle, as an afterlife of thatwhich is understood; and what has been recognized in the analysis of the \"after-life of works;' in the analysis of \"fame;' is therefore to be considered the founda-tion of history in general.

Even his gratitude, which per-haps results in a small percentage more, would hardly seem to her a sufficientbasis. How then, in her unconscious understanding of men, does she calculate?This we cannot comprehend, so long as money is thought of here as only ameans of payment or a gift. Certainly the whore's love is for sale. But not herclient's shame. The latter seeks some hiding place during this quarter-hour, andfinds the most genial: in money. There are as many nuances of payment as thereare nuances of lovemaking-lazy and swift, furtive or brutal. What does thissignify? The shame-reddened wound on the body of society secretes money andcloses up. It fonns a metallic scab. We leave to the roue the cheap pleasure ofbelieving himself devoid of shame.

[01 a,S]Comparison of today's erotic fields of action with those of the middle of theprevious century. The social play of eroticism turns today on the question: Howfar can a respectable woman go without losing herself? To represent the joys ofadultery without its actual circumstances is a favorite device of dramatists. Theterrain on which love's duel with society unfolds is thus, in a very broad sense,the realm of \"free\" love. For the Forties, Fifties, and Sixties of the previouscentury, however, things were entirely different. Nothing illustrates this moreclearly than the account of the \"pensions\" which Ferdinand von Gall provides inhis book Paris und seine Salons (Oldenburg, 1844-1845) &lt;vol. 1, pp. 225-231&gt;.cD,ere we learn that in many of these boardinghouses at the evening meal-which, with prior notification, strangers too could attend-it was the fille tobring in cocottes, whose job it was to play the part of girls from good families. Infact, they were not disposed to let down their masks too quickly, preferringinstead to wrap themselves in endless layers of respectability and fanilly COmlec-tion; to strip these away entailed an elaborate game of intrigues that ultimatelyserved to raise the womenls price. What is expressed in these relations, it goeswithout saying, is less the period's pruderie than its fanatical love of masquerade.[02,1]More on the mania for masks: \"We know from the statistics on prostitution thatthe fallen woman takes a certain pride in being deemed by nature still worthy ofmotherhood-a feeling that in no way excludes her aversion to the hardship anddisfigurement that goes along with this honor. She thus willingly chooses a middleway to exhibit her condition: she keeps it 'for two months, for three months,'naturally not longer.\" F. Th. Vischer, Mode und Cynismus (Stuttgart, 1879), p. 7.o Fashion 0 [02,2]In prostitution, one finds expressed the revolutionary side of technology (thesymbolic side, which creates no less than discovers). \"As if the laws of nature towhich love submits were not more tyrannical and more odious than the laws ofsociety! The metaphysical meaning of sadism is the hope that the revolt of manwill take on such intensily as to summon nature to change its laws. For, withwomen no longer wanting to endure the ordeal of pregnancy, the risks and thesufferings of delivery and of miscarriage, nature will be constrained to inventsome other means for perpetuating humanity on this earth.\" Emmanuel Berl,\"Premier Panlphlet;' Europe, 75 &lt;1929&gt;, pp. 405-406.

What meaning the factor of time might have for the process of gamblingitself is at issue in neither Gourdon nor France. And the pastime of gambling is,in fact, a singular matter. A game passes the time more quickly as chance comesto light more absolutely in it, as the number of combinations encountered in thecourse of play (of coups) is smaller and their sequence shorter. In other words, thegreater the component of chance in a game, the more speedily it elapses. Thisstate of affairs becomes decisive in the disposition of what comprises the authen-tic \"intoxication\" of the gambler.

For it begins with the decision to cover the walls withshining metal plates. I ... That is the first step on the way to the new valuation ofspace at work in the Crystal Palace. In the domed chamber of the Mycenaeans,this conception of space was already so decidedly in force that the entire space ofthe room could be dissolved in luster ... In this way, however, one sacrificed thatfundamental means of all spatial organization: contrast. The whole of the succeed-ing historical development was determined through this means-although, fromthe perspective of what concerns us at present, this development first begins only athousand years later, and then no longer with the 'luster' of metal but with that ofglass. I ... The high point here is with the window of the Gothic cathedral. ...The increasing transparency of glass in colorless glazing draws the outer worldinto the interior space, while covering the walls with mirrors projects the image ofthe interior space into the outer world. In either case the 'wall,' as a container of'space, is deprived of its significance. The ~luster' increasingly forfeits the distinc-tive color that was part of its character and becomes ever more exclusively just amirror of external light. I This process culminated in the profane interior space of'the seventeenth century, where it was no longer only the embrasures of windowsthat were filled with plate glass clear as water, but also the remaining surfaces ofthe wall surrounding the room, particularly in places that lay opposite a windowopening: in the 'mirror galleries of the rococo interiors.'

To thefirst, \"Benediction\"; to the second, \"Delphine et Hippolyte\"; to the third, \"LesLitanies de Satan.\" [S8,4]Zarathustr'a has, first of all, appropriated to himself the tectonic elements ofJugendstil, in contrast to its organic motifs. The pauses especially, which arecharacteristic of his rhytlunics, are an exact counterpart to the tectonic phenome-non so basic to this style-namely, the predominance of the hollow form over thefilled form. [S8,5]Certain themes of Jugendstil are derived from technological forms. Thus theprofiles of iron supports that appear as ornamental motifs on fa,ades. See theessay [by Martin?] in the Franlifitder Zeitung, circa 1926-1929. [S8,6]\"Benediction\": \"So thoroughly will I twist this miserable tree I that it will neverput forth its evil-smelling buds!\"'\" The plant motif of Jugendstil, and its line,appear here-and certainly not in a passage more ready to hand. [S8,7]Jugendstil forces the auratic. Never has the sun worn a more glorious aureole;never was the eye of man more radiant than with Fidus. Maeterlinck pushes theunfolding of the auratic to the point of absurdity. The silence of the characters inhis plays is one of its manifestations. Baudelaire's \"Perte d'aureole\"20 stands in themost decided opposition to this Jugendstil motif. [S8,8]Jugendstil is the second attempt on the part of art to come to terms with technol-ogy. The first attempt was realism. There the problem was more or less present inthe consciousness of the artists, who were uneasy about the new processes oftechnological reproduction. (The theory of realism demonstrates this; see S5,5.)lnJugendstil, the problem as such was already prey to repression. Jugendstil nolonger saw itself threatened by the competing technology. And so the confronta-tion with teclmology that lies hidden within it was all the more aggressive. Itsrecourse to technological motifs arises from the effort to sterilize them ornamen-tally. (It was tlus, we may say in passing, that gave Adolf Loos's struggle againstornament its salient political significance.) [S8a,1]"

Insightinto these conditions engenders a strain at the threshold of its consciousness.Hence the mysticism (Maeterlinck) which seeks to deflect this pressure; buthence also the reception of technological forms in Jugendstil-for example, ofhollow space. [S9,4]The chapter in Zarathustra entitled \"Unter T6chtern der Wiiste\" &lt;Among theDaughters of the Desert&gt; is instructive, not only for the fact that the flowermaidens-an important Jugendstil motif-make an appearance here inNietzsche, but also in view of Nietzsche's kinship with Guys. The phrase \"deepbut without thoughts'\"'' perfectly captures the expression worn by the prostitutesin Guys.

The frigid woman embodies the ideal of beauty in Jugendstil.(Jugendstil sees in every woman not Helena but Olympia.) [S9.,2]Individual, group, mass-the group is the principle of genre. For Jugendstil, theisolation of the individual is typical (see Ibsen). [S9a,3]Jugendstil represents an advance, insofar as the bourgeoisie gains access to thetechnological bases of its control over nature; a regression, insofar as it loses thepower of looking the everyday in the face. (That can still be done only within thesecurity of the saving lie.)25-The bourgeoisie senses that its days are numbered;all the more it wishes to stay young.

And the conceptionwhich the Society of Seasons:; has of the I.aristocracy' shows how closely the ideasof the revolutionary communists in France, at that time, were connected to theideas of the bourgeois revolutionaries of the eighteenth century and the liberalopposition during the Restoration .... Like Augustin Thierry, the French revolu-tionary communists began with the idea that the struggle against the aristocracywas necessarily in the interests of all the rest of society.

And with this, themoralistic element-here in antimaterialist form-is registered very dearly.\"One filay ... assert in very general temlS that ... the distinction between filentaland manual labor is not one between mental and material nature; that, rather, thereward is ultimately required in the latter case only for the internal aspect ofwork, for the aversion to exertion, for the conscription of will power. Of course,this intellectuality, which is, as it were, the thing-in-itselfbehind the appearance ofwork ... , is not really intellectual but resides in emotion and the will. It followsfrom this that it is not coordinated with mental labor but rather is its basis. For atfirst the objective content ... , the result ... , the demand for reward is producednot in it but in ... the expenditure of energy that it requires for the production ofthis intellectual content. In that an act of the soul is revealed to be the source ofvalue ... , physical and 'mental' labor contain a conunon (one might say, mor-ally) value-grounding base, through which the reduction oflabor value as such tophysical labor loses its philistine and brutal materialistic appearance. This isroughly the case with theoretical materialism, which acquires a completely newand more seriously discussible basis if one emphasizes that matter itself is also aconception, not an essence which, ... in the absolute sense, stands opposed to thesoul but which in its cogrrizability is completely detemrined by the forms andpresuppositions oLour intellectual organization?' Of course, with these reflec-tions «Philosophie des Geldes (Leipzig, 1900),&gt; pp. 449-450), Sinunel is playingdevil's advocate, for he does not want to admit the reduction oflabor to physicallabor. Indeed there is also, according to hinl, a valueless labor that still requiresan expenditure of energy. \"Tills means, however, that the value of labor ismeasured not by its amount but by the utility of its result!\" Sinunel goes on toreproach Marx, as it appears, for confusing a statement of fact with a demand.He writes: \"socialism, in fact, strives for a ... society in which the utility value ofobjects, in relation to the labor time applied to them, forms a constant\" «ibid.,&gt;p. 451). \"In the third volume of Capital, Marx argues that the precondition of allvalue, of the labor theory too, is use value. Yet this means that so many parts ofthe total social labor time are used in each product as come in relation to itsimportance in use .... The approximation to this completely utopian state ofaffairs seems to be technically possible only if, as a whole, nothing but the ...unquestionably basic life necessities are produced. For where this is exclusivelythe case, one work activity is of course precisely as necessary and useful as thenext. In contrast, however, as long as one moves into the higher spheres in which,on the one hand, need and estimation of utility are inevitably more individualand, on the other, the intensity oflabor is more difficult to prove, no regulation ofthe amounts of production could bring about a situation in which the relation-ship between need and labor applied was everywhere the same.

Political revolu-tion's ... attitude to civil society, to the world of need, to work, private interests,and private law, is that they are ... its natural basis. Finally, man as a member ofcivil society counts for true man, for man as distinct from the citizen, because he isman in his sensuous ... existence, while political man is only the abstract ...man .... The abstraction of the political man is thus correctly described hy Rous-seau: \"He who dares to undertake the making of a people's institutions ought tofeel himself' capable ... of changing human nature, of transforming each individ-ual, who is by himself' a complete and solitary whole, into part of a greater wholefrom which he ... receives his life and being' (Contrat social [London, 1782], voL2, p. 67).?? Marx, -~Zur Judenfrage,\" in 'Marx and Engels, Gesamtausgabe, vol. 1,section 1, 1 (Frankfurt am Main, 1927), pp. 595-599.'\" [X13]The property appertaining to the commodity as its fetish character attaches aswell to the commodity-producing society-not as it is in itself, to be sure, butmore as it represents itself and thinks to understand itself whenever it abstractsfrom the fact that it produces precisely commodities. The image that it producesof itself in this way, and that it customarily labels as its culture, corresponds to theconcept of phantasmagoria (compare \"Eduard Fuchs, Collector and Historian,\"section 3).\" The latter is defined by Wiesengrund \"as a consumer item in whichthere is no longer anything that is supposed to remind us how it came into being.It becomes a magical object, insofar as the labor stored up in it comes to seemsupernatural and sacred at the very moment when it can no longer be recognizedas labor\" (T W Adorno, \"Fragmente tiber Wagner;' Zeitschrffl}iir Sozia/for-schung, 8, nos. 1-2 [1939], p. 17).

The physionotrace was based on the well-known prin-ciple of the pantograph. A system of parallelograms was articulated in such a wayas to be capable of transfer to a horizontal plane. With the aid of a dry stylus, theoperator traces the contours of a drawing. An inked stylus traces the lines of thefirst stylus, and reproduces the drawing on a scale determined by the relativeposition of the two styluses:' Gisela Freund, \"La Photographie au point de vuesociologique\" (manuscript, pp. 19-20).

It is characteristic that the begitmings ofthe technologizing of the portrait, as instanced in this apparatus, set back the artof the portrait qualitatively as much as photography later advanced it. \"One cansee, on examining the quite enormous body of work produced with thephysionotrace, that the portraits all have the same expression: stiff, schematic,and featureless ....

Both wereinherited from the ancients .... The clock was the first automatic device appliedto practical purposes; the whole theory of the production of regular motion wasdeveloped through it. Its nature is such that it is hased on a comhination of semiar-tis tic handicraft and direct theory. Cardanus, for instance, wrote ahout (and gavepractical formulas for) the construction of clocks. German authors of the six-teenth century (~alled clockmaking \"learned (nonguild) handicraft' and it would hepossible to show from the development of the dock how entirely different therelation between science and practice was in t.he context of handicraf't from what itis, for instance, in modern large-scale industry. There is also no doubt thnt in theeighteenth century the idea of applying automatic devices (moved by springs) toproduction was first suggested by the clock. It can be proved historically thatVaucanson's experiments along these lines had a tremendous influence on theimagination of' English inventors.

Almost all the great mathematicians since themiddle of the seventeenth century, so far as they dealt with practical mechanicsand worked out its theoretical side~ started from the simple water-driven cornmill. And indeed this was why the name Miihle, \"mill,' which arose during themanufacturing period, came to be applied to all mechanical forms of motive poweradapted to practical purposes. But in the case of the mill, as in that of the press,the forge, the plough, and other implements, the work proper-that of beating,crushing, grinding, pulverizing, and so on-has been performed from the veryfirst without human labor, even though the moving force was human or animal.This kind of' machinery is therefore very ancient .... Hence, it is practically theonly maehinery found in the manufacturing period.

[m2a,4]In feudal society, leisure-freedom from labor-was a recognized privilege. Inbourgeois society, it is no longer so. What distinguishes leisure, as feudalismunderstands it, is that it communicates with two socially important types ofbehavior. Religious contemplation and court life represented, as it were, thematrices through which the leisure of the grand seigneur, of the prelate, of thewarrior could be molded. These attitudes-that of piety no less than that ofrepresentation-were advantageous to the poet. His work in tum benefitedthem, at !east indirectly, insofar as it maintained contact with both the religionand the life at court. (Voltaire was the first of the great literati to break with thechurch; so much the less did he disdain to secure a place at the court of Frederickthe Great.) In feudal society, the leisure of the poet is a recognized privilege. It isonly in bourgeois society that the poet becomes an idler. [m2a,5]"

When this issue appeared, there was a passage in an article by mewhich, by its fonn and its moderation, exasperated Claire.-She wrote to me thatshe was going to respond to it.-But ... her response became a pamphlet, whichshe then decided to publish on its own, outside the framework of the peri·odical ....

Christianity ... ina nlanner ... favorable to our sex: I mean M. James de Laurence, the author of apamphlet entitled Les Enfonts de dieu, ou La Religion de }lfsus . ... The author isno Saint·SinlOnian; ... he postulates ... an inheritance through the mother.Certainly this system ... is highly advantageous to us; I am convinced that somepart of it will have a place ... in the religion of the future, and that the principleof motherhood will become one of the fundamental laws of the state'\" (ClaireDemar, Ma loi d'avenir: Ouvrage posthume pub/it par Suzanne [paris, 1834], pp. 14-16).

The blame for this is said to reside in the fact that in these thingsLaurence propounds mystery as a principle; on the strength of such mystery, wewould have to render account in these things to a mystical God alone. La Tribunedes Femmes, on the contrary, believes that \"the Society of the Future will befounded not on mystery but on trust; for mystery merely prolongs the exploita·tion of our sex!'

This point granted, the best ramparts for Paris will be those thepopulation finds to be best-the ramparts most intimately suited to the tastes,customs, ideas, and needs of an armed bourgeoisie.

Many of the sketches are crossed out inBenjamin's manuscript, presumably because in most cases they were revised and transferred to themanuscript of the convolutes; these canceled sketches are printed here in a smaller typesizc, withcross-references to the con\"esponding entries in the convolutes and early drafts. (Some of the UllCatl-celed sketches, in the larger typesize, were also transferred to the convolutes, and are accordinglycross-referenced.) Cross-references should not be considered exhaustive.

Thearcade is a street of lascivious commerce only; it is wholly adapted to arousing desires.Thus, there is no mystery in the fact that whores feel spontaneously drawn there. Becausein this street all the juices slow to a standstill, the commodity proliferates along the housefronts and enters into new and fantastic combinations, like the tissue in tUmors. &lt;A 0,6&gt;The will turns down the wide street into the teeth of pleasure and, as lust, dragswith it into its gloomy bed whatever it finds in the way of fetish, talisman, andgage of fate across its path, drags with it the rotting debris of letters, kisses, andnames. Love presses forward with the inquisitive fingers of desire down thewinding street. Its way leads through the interior of the lover, which opens up tohim in the inlage of the beloved who passes lightly before him. 11ns inlage opensup his interior to him for the first time. For, as the voice of the truly belovedawakens in his heart an answering voice which he has never before heard inhimself, the words which she speaks awaken in him thoughts of tlns new, muchmore hidden ego that reveals to him her mage, willie the touch of her handawakens &lt;broken off&gt; &lt;N,7]Game in which children have to form a brief sentence out of given words. Thisgame is seemingly played by the goods on display: binoculars and flower seeds,screws and musical scores, makeup and stuffed vipers, fur coats and revolvers.&lt;A 0,8&gt;Maurice Renard, in his book Le Pen'l bleu,l has told how inhabitants of a distant planetcome to study the flora and fauna indigenous to the lower depths of the atmosphere-inother words, to the surface of the earth. These interplanetary travelers see in humanbeings the equivalent of tiny &lt;?&gt; deep-sea fish-that is to say, beings who live at thebottom of a sea. We no more feel the pressure of the atmosphere than fish feel that of thewater; this in no way alters the fact that both sets of creatures reside on an ocean floor.With the study of the arcades, a closely related reorientation in space is opened up. TIlestreet itself is thereby manifest as &lt;x&gt; well-worn interior: as living space of the collective,for true collectives as such inhabit the street. The collective is an eternally awake, eter-nally agitated being that-in the space between the building fronts-lives, experiences,understands, invents as much as individuals do within the privacy of their own four walls.For it, for this collective, enalueled shop signs are a wall decoration as good as, if notbetter than, the inexpensive oleograph above the hearth. Walls with their \"Post No Bills\"are its writing desk, newspaper stands its libraries, display windows its glazed inaccessiblearmoires, mailboxes its bronzes, benches its bedroom furniture, and the cafe terrace is thebalcony from which it looks down on its household. As with a railing where pavers hangtheir coats before going to work, the vestibule is the hidden gateway which gives onto arow of courtyards-is, for it, the corridor that daunts the stTangers and serves as the keyto its dwelling. &lt;See dO,l and M3a,4.&gt; &lt;A°,9&gt;A factory of 5,000 workers for weddings and banquets.

Nowhere does one find the hubbubof a Berlin restaurant, where patrons like to give themselves airs and where foodis only a pretext or necessity. I know a shabby, dark room in the very middle ofwhich, a few minutes past noon, milliners from nearby shops gather around longmarble tables. They are the only customers, keeping quite to themselves, andthey have little to say to one another during their short lunch break. And yet-itis merely a whispering, from which the clinking of knives and forks (refined,dainty, as though punctuated) continuously rises. In a \"Chauffeurs' Rendez-vous;' as the small bistros like to call themselves, a poet and tlunker can have hisbreakfast and, in an international company of Russian, Italian, and French taxidrivers, advance his thoughts a good distance. If he wants, however, to enjoy theundivided sociable silence of a public repast, he will not turn his steps toward anyof tl,e venerable old Paris restaurants, and still less toward one of the newer chicestablishments; rather, he goes to seek out, in a remote quartier, the new Parisianmosque. TI,ere he finds, along with the indoor garden and its fountains, alongwith the obligatory bazaar full of carpets, fabrics, and copperware, three or fourmedium-sized rooms furnished with stools and divans and lit by hanging lamps.He must of course bid adieu not only to French cooking, which he exchanges fora choice Middle Eastern cuisine, but above all to French wines.

That is, we are trained toview things, in the historical sphere, from a romantic distance. To account for thedirectly transmitted inheritance is important.

In this sense,one and the same phenomenon is at work in the Surrealists and in Heidegger. &lt;See S1,6.&gt;&lt;ooA&gt;It is said dlat the dialectical method consists in doing justice, at each moment, to theconcrete historical situation of its object. But that is not enough. For it is just as much amatter of doing justice to the concrete historical situation of the interest taken in the object.And this situation is always so constituted as to be itself preformed in that object; aboveall, however, the object is felt to be concretized in this situation itself and upraised from itsformer being into the higher concretion of now~being &lt;Jetztsein.&gt;. In what way this now-being (which is something other than the now-being of the present time &lt;Jehheit» alreadysignifies, in itself, a higher concretion-this question, of course, can be entertained by thedialectical method only within the purview of a philosophy of history that at all points hasovercome the ideology of progress. In regard to such a philosophy, one could speak. of anincreasing concentration (integration) of reality, such that everything past (in its time) canacquire a higher grade of actuality than it had in the moment of its existing. How it adaptsto this, its own higher actuality, is something determined and brought to pass by the imageas which and in which it is comprehended.-To treat the past (better: what has been) inaccordance with a method that is no longer historical but political. To make politicalcategories into theoretical categories, insofar as one dared to apply them only in the senseof praxis, because only to the present-that is the task. The dialectical penetration andactualization of former contexts puts the truth of all present action to the test. This means,however: the explosive materials latent in fashion (which always refers back to somethingpast) have to be ignited. &lt;See K2,3.&gt; &lt;0\",5&gt;On the figure of the collector. One may start from the fact that the true collector detachesthe object from its functional relations. But that is hardly an exhaustive description of thisremarkable mode of behavior. For isn't this the foundation (to speak with Kant andSchopenhauer) of that \"disinterested\" contemplation by virtue of which the conectorattains to an tmequaled view of the object-a view which takes in more, and other, thanthat of the profane owner and which we would do best to compare to the gaze of the greatphysiognomist? But how his eye comes to rest on the object is a matter elucidated muchmore sharply through &lt;another&gt; consideration. &lt;See H2,7; H2a,l.&gt; &lt;00 ,6&gt;"

Ordered, however, according to a surprising and, for the profaneunderstanding, incomprehensible cOlmection. This connection stands to the customaryordering and schematization of things something as their arrangement in the dictionarystands to a natural arrangement. We need only recall what importance a particular collec-tor attaches not only to his object but also to its entire past, whether this concerns theorigin and objective characteristics of the thing or the details of its ostensibly externalhistory: previous owners, price of purchase, current value, and so on. All of these-the\"objective\" data together with the other-come together, for the true collector, in everysingle Oile of his possessions, to form a whole magic encyclopedia, a world order, whoseoutline is the fole of his object. Here, therefore, within this circumscribed field, we canunderstand how great physiognomists (and collectors are physiognomists of the world ofdungs) become interpreters of fate. It suffices to observe just one collector as he handlesthe items in Ius showcase. No sooner does he hold them in his hands than he appearsinspired by them and seems to look through them into their distance, like an augur.

In the diffuse light from above, one skimmedover flagstones. While here a new thoroughfare was being prepared for the mostfashionable Paris, one of the oldest arcades in the city has disappeared-thePassage de I'Opera, swallowed up by the opening of the Boulevard Haussmann.Just as that remarkable covered walkway had done for an earlier generation, sotoday a few arcades still preserve, in dazzling light and shadowy comers, a pastbecome space. Antiquated trades survive within these inner spaces, and themerchandise on display is unintelligible, or else has several meanings. Alreadythe inscriptions and signs on the entranceways (one could just as well say \"exits,\"since, with these peculiar hybrid forms of house and street, every gate is simulta-neously entrance and exit), already the inscriptions which multiply along thewalls within, where here and there between overloaded coatstands a spiral stair-case rises into darkness-already they have about them something enigmatic.''Albert at No. 83\" will in all likelihood be a hairdresser, and \"Theatrical Tights\"will be silk tights; but these insistent letterings want to say more. And who wouldhave the courage to take the ·dilapidated stairs up one flight to the beauty salon ofProfessor Alfred Bitterlin?

Paris created this type. VYhat is reularkable is that it wasn't Rome.And the reason? Just this: does not dreaming itself take the high road in Rome?And isn't that city too full of themes, of monuments, enclosed squares, nationalshrines, to be able to enter tout entiere-with evety cobblestone, every shop sign,every step, and every gateway-into the passerby's dream? The national charac-ter of the Italians may also have much to do with this.

Benjamin himself filed the text at the begimung of ConvoluteG. Rolf Ticdemrull suggests that it may have been intended as a radio broadcast for young people,but thinks it more likely to have been a newspaper or magazine article that was never published. TIlepiece was written in 1928 or 1929.The beginning of the nineteenth century witnessed those initial experiments iniron construction whose results, in conjunction with those obtained frolll experi-ments with the steam engine, would so thoroughly transform the face of Europeby the end of the century. Rather than attempt a historical account of this proc-ess, we would like to focus SOme scattered reflections on a small vignette whichhas been extracted from the middle of the century (as from the middle of thethick book that contains it), and which indicates, although in grotesque style,what limitless possibilities were seen revealed by construction in iron. The picturecomes from a work of 1844-Grandville's Another World-and illustrates theadventures of a fantastic little hobgoblin who is trying to find his way aroundouter space: ''A bridge-its two ends could not be embraced at a single glanceand its piers were resting on planets-led from one world to another by a cause-way of wonderfully smooth asphalt. The three-hundred-tlnrty-three-thousandthpier rested on Saturn. There our goblin noticed tllat the ring around this planetwas notlnng other than a circular balcony on which tlle inhabitants of Saturnstrolled in the evening to get a breatll of fresh air:'Gas candelabra appear in our picture as well. They could not be overlooked, inthose days, when speaking of the achievements of technology. Whereas for usgas lighting often has about it something dismal arid oppressive, in that age itrepresented the height of luxury and splendor. When Napoleon was interred inthe church of Les Invalides, the scene lacked nothing: in addition to velvet, silk,gold and silver, and wreaths of the inmlOrtals, there was an eternal lamp of gasover the resting place. An engineer in Lancaster had invented a device thatpeople regarded as a veritable miracle-a mechatnsm by which the church clockover the tomb was automatically illuminated by gaslight at dusk and by winchthe flanles were automatically extinguished at daybreak."

Out of these galleries emerged, a little later on, the great depart-ment stores, of which the pioneering model, Au Bon MarchC, was designed bythe builder of the Eiffel Tower.Iron construction began with winter gardens and arcades-that is, with genuineluxury establishments. Very quickly, however, it found its true range of technicaland industrial application. What resulted were constructions that had no prece-dent and that were occasioned by wholly new needs: covered markets, railroadstations, exhibition halls. Engineers led the way. But poets, as well, displayedamazing foresight. Thus, the French Romantic Gautier declares: \"A proper archi-tecture will be created the moment we begin making use of the new materialsfurnished by the new industry. The advent of cast iron enables and calls for manynew forms, as we can see in railroad tenninals, suspension bridges, and thearches of winter gardens:' Offenbach's Parisian Lift was the first theatrical pieceto be set in a railroad station. \"Railway depots,\" they used to be called back then;and they inspired the strangest notions. A decidedly progressive Belgian painter,Antoine Wiertz, sought permission around midcentury to decorate tl,e halls ofrailroad stations with frescoes.Step by step, the technology of that era took possession of new fields; it did so inthe face of difficulties and objections of which today we can scarcely form aconception. In the 1830s in England, for example, a bitter controversy arose overthe issue of iron rails. Under no circumstances, it was argued, could enough ironever be procured for the English railway system (at that time plal1l1ed on ouly thesmallest scale). The \"steam carriages\" would have to nm on lanes of granite.Alongside the theoretical battles were ongoing practical struggles with materials.Tbe story of the bridge over the Firth ofTay is an especially memorable exanlple.Six years were required for the construction of this bridge: 1872 to 1878. Andshortly before its completion, on February 2, 1877, a hurricane (of the particularlyviolent sort that assail the inlet of the Tay and that also caused the catastrophe of1879)1 blew down two of the biggest supporting piers. And not only bridgeconstruction made such denlands on the patience of engineers; with turme1s, itwas no clifferent. When, in 1858, plans were afoot for the twelve-kilometertul1l1el through Mont Cenis, the estimated length of time for tl,e work was sevenyears.Thus, while in great things heroic efforts were expended on precedent-setting,groundbreaking achievements, in little matters there was often-strange to say-something motley.

Itdefends the rights of the corpse before the living being, which it couples to theinorganic world. The fetishism that succumbs to the sex appeal of the commod-ity is its vital nerve.

The Paris of hispoems is a sunken city, and more submarine than subterranean. It is the city of adeath-franght idyll. Yet the substrate of this idyll is nothing natural, and consistsin neither the subterranean channels of Paris nor its catacombs and the legendsthat have grown up around them. It is, rather, a social, and that is to say, amodern substrate. But precisely the modern, la rnoderniti, is always citing primalhistory. Here, this occurs through the ambiguity peculiar to d,e social relationsand products of this epoch. The twilight of the arcades, which contemporariescompared to an undersea landscape, lies over the society that built d,em. Theirconstruction itself is ambiguous. They stand midway between house and street,on the one hand; between pavilion and hall, on the other. At the same time, thisambiguity set the tone for the market of love.

    "text": "[1] (Balzac was the first to speak of the ruins of the bourgeoisie. But he stillknew nothing about them. It was Surrealism which first got a glimpse ofthe field of debris left behind by the capitalist development of d,e forces ofproduction. )But it was Surrealism that first opened our eyes to them. These ruins became,for Surrealism, the object of a research no less inlpassioned than that which thehumanists of the Renaissance conducted on the rellmants of classical antiqnity.Painters like Picasso and Chirico allude to this analogy. This unrelenting con-frontation of the recent past with the present moment is something new, histori-cally. Other contiguous links in the chain of generations have existed within thecollective consciousness, but they were hardly distinguished from one anotherwithin the collective. The present, however, already stands to the recent past asthe awakening stands to the dreanl. The development of the forces of produc-tiou, in the course of the previous century, shattered that centuris wish synlbolseven before the monuments representing them had collapsed, and before thepaper on which they were rendered had yellowed. In the nineteenth century, thisdevelopment of the forces of production worked to emancipate d,e forms ofconstnlction from art, just as in the sixteenth century the sciences freed them-selves from philosophy. A start is made widl architecture as engineered consUUc-tion. Then comes the reproduction of nature as photography. The creation offantasy prepares to become practical as commercial art. Literature submits tomontage in the feuilleton. All these products are on the point of entering themarket as commodities. But dley linger on the threshold. They stop halfway.Value and commodity enter on a brief engagement before d,e market pricemakes their union legitimate. From this epoch derive the arcades and interieurs,the exhibition halls and panoranlas. They are residues of a dreanl world. Butgiven d,at the realization of dream elements, in the course of waking up, is theparadigm of dialectical thinking, it follows that dialectical thinking is d,e organ ofhistorical awakening. Only dialectical thinking is equal to the recent past, becauseit is, each time, its offspring. Every epoch, in fact, not only dreams the one tofollow but, in thus dreaming, precipitates its awakening. It bears its end withinitself and unfolds it-as Hegel already noticed-by cunning. The earliest monu-ments of the bourgeoisie began to cmmble long ago, but we recognize, for thefirst time, how they were destined for d,is end from the beginning."

    "text": "Dialectics at a StandstillApproaches to the Passagen-Werk.By Rolf TiedemannThere are books whose fate has been settled long before they even exist as books.Benjamin's unfinished paJsagen-Werk is just such a case, Many legends have been wovenaround it since Adorno first mentioned it in an essay published in 1950. 1 Those legendsbecalne even more complexly embroidered after a two-volume selection of Benjamin'sletters appeared, which abounded in statements about his intentions for the project. Butthese statements were neither complete nor cohercnt. 2 As a result, the most contradictoryrumors spread about a book that competing Benjamin interpreters persistently referred toin the hope that it would solve the puzzles raised by his intellectual physiognomy. 111a1:hope has remained um\"ealized. The answer that the fraglnents of the Passagen-Werk. give toits readers instead follows Mephisto's retort, \"Many a riddle is made here,\" with Faust'sI~Many a riddle must be solved here.\"In fact, for some years the texts that provide the most reliable information about theproject Benjamin worked on for thirteen years, from 1927 until his death in 1940, andthat he regarded as his masterpiece, have been available. Most of dle more importanttexts he wrote during the last decade of his life are offshoots of the Passagen-Werk., If it hadbeen completed, it would have become nothing less than a materialist philosophy of thehistory of dle nineteenth century. The expose entitled \"PariSI the Capital of the Nine-teenth CenL1Jry\" (1935) provides us with a summary of the themes and motifs Benjaminwas concerned with in the larger work. TIle text introduces the concept of \"historicalschematism\" (5:1150),3 which was to serve as the basic plan for Benjamin's constmctionof the nineteenth century. On the other hand, \"Das Kunstwerk lin Zeitalter seiner techni-schen Reproduzierbarkeit\" (The Work of Art in the Age of Technological Reproducibil-ity; 1935-1936) has no thematic connection with the Passagen-Werk (dealing withphenomena belonging to the twentieth rather than to the nineteenth century), but isnevertheless relevant from dle point of view of methodology. In that essay, Benjamin triesto \"pinpoint the precise spot in the present my historical construction would take as itsvanishing point' (Letters, 509), '\"Dle greatl fragmentary work on Baudelaire, which cameinto being in the years 1937-1939, offers a \"miniature model\" of The Arcades Prqject, TIlemethodological problems raised by the \"Work of Art\" essay were, in their turn, addressedonce more in the theses I~Ober den BegrifI der Geschichte\" (On the Concept of History).In Adorno's opinion, dlese theses \"more or less summarize the epistemological considera-tions that developed concurrently with The Arcades Prqject.\"4 vVhat survives of this proj-ect-the countless notes and excerpts that constitute the fifth volume of BenjaminlsNotes for tllis essay begin on page 1012."

    "text": "Gesannnelte Schriften-rarely go theoretically beyond positions that have been formulatedmore radically in the texts mentioned above. Any study of the Passagen-Werk (Benjamin'sintentions hardly lay themselves open to a simple penlsal) must therefore deal with the\"Work of Art\" essay, the texts devoted to Baudelaire, and the theses \"On the Concept ofHistory.\" 111ese must always be present to the student's mind, even though they aremanifestly autonomous-writings either introductory to the Passagen- Werk or distinctfrom it.The published volumes of the Passagen- Werk begin with two texts in which Benjaminpresents the project in summary, first in 1935 and again in 1939. Together with the earlyessay \"Der Saturnring, oder Etwas vom Eisenbau\" (The Ring of Saturn, or Some Re-marks on Iron Constluction), these texts are the only ones belonging to the Arcadescomplex that may be said to be complete. They were not, however, intended for publica-tion. The earlier, German one was written for the Institut fUr Sozialforschung, which, as aresult, accepted the Passagen- Werk as one of its sponsored research projects. The othertext, written in French, came into being at Max Horkheimer's instigation: Horkheimerhoped to make use of it to interest an American patron in Benjamin. TIle most importantpart, as well as the lengthiest section, of Volume 5 of the Gesammelte Schrifien consists ofthe manuscript of the \"Aufzeichnungen und Materialien\" (Notes and Materials; herecalled the \"Convolutes\"), which is subdivided thematically. This is dIe manuscript thathad been hidden in the Bibliotheque Nationale during World War II.Benjamin probably worked on this manuscript from the fall or winter of 1928 until theend of 1929, and then again from the beginning of 1934. The last entries were made inthe spring of 1940, immediately before Bel~amin fled Paris. The present order of thenotes does not correspond to the order in which they were Oliginally composed. It seemsthat Benjamin would begin a new convolute, or sheaf of notes, whenever a new themesuggested itself and demanded to be h·eated. Within the different sheafs that were com-posed simultaneously, the notes may evince the chronological order in which they werewritten down. Yet even this chronology is not always identical with that of the notes'actual conception. At the beginnings of those rubrics that had guided his research in itsearliest stage, we find notes Benjamin incorporated from older manuscripts. Here thenotes have been rearranged, and therefore the first pages of the respective collections ofmaterial follow certain clear principles. By contrast, rubrics either added to or newlybegun from 1934 onward generally owe their order to the coincidences of Benjamin'sstudies or, even more so, to his reading. 5The section \"Erste Notizen\" (5:991-1038), here called \"First Sketches,\" consists ofconsecutive notes that were begun about the middle of 1927 and terminated in December1929 or, at the latest, by the beginning of 1930. \"'-n1ey are published in their entirety, evendlOugh their contents have for the most part been incorporated into the larger \"Convo-lutes\" section. It is only with their help that we can trace the \"transformation process\" thatdetermined the transition from the lint stage of the work to the second. The first of the\"Friihe Entwiirfe\" (Early Drafts) entitled \"Passagen\" (Arcades), dates back to the veryfirst phase of the work, mid-1927, when Ber~amin intended to collaborate with FranzHessel on a journal article. The draft may well have been written by Bel~amin and Hesseltogether. \"Pariser Passagen II\" (here called \"The Arcades of Paris\") shows Benjamin'sattempts in 1928 and 1929 to write the essay he thought the PasJagen-Werk would be-come. Benjamin wrote these texts in a format totally unusual for him and on veryexpensive handmade paper, which he never used before or after. One can easily imaginethat he approached their composition as he would a festive occasion. But he did not getvery far. The discrete texts, whose sequence he did not establish, are soon interspersed"

Both the \"Convolutes\" and the \"First Sketches\" are published in extenso asthey are found in the manuscript, but \"The ATcades of Paris\" is treated in a differentmanner. TIle notes and quotations in this manuscript were never really worked out: theymust have either been transferred to the \"Convolutes\" or been discarded. They havetherefore not been included in this edition. Only fully fonnulated texts have been publish-ed; their order has been established by the editor. These texts, among the most importantand, in may say so, the most beautiful of Benjamin's texts, surface again at vaTious placesin the \"Convolutes.\" Published as a whole, however, they convey an impression of theessay Benjamin mulled over but never actually wrote. The last text, \"The Ring of Saturn,or Some Remarks on Iron Construction,\" also belongs to the first phase of his project. Itmay, in fact, be a jounlal or newspaper article, an offshoot of the Passagen- Wed whichnever made it into print.'\"The fragments of the Passagen-Werk can be compared to the materials used in buildinga house, the outline of which has just been marked in the ground or whose foundationsare just being dug. In the two exposes that open the fifth volume of the C(:sammelteSchrfften, Benjamin sketches broad outlines of the plan as he had envisaged it in 1935 andin 1939. The five or six sections of each expose should have corresponded to the samenumber of chapters in the book or, to continue the analogy, to the five or six floors of theprojected house. Next to the foundations we find the neatly piled excerpts, which wouldhave been used to constnlct the walls; Bel~alnil1's own thoughts would have provided themortar to hold the building together. The reader now possesses many of these theoreticaland interpretive reflections, yet ill the end they almost seem to vanish beneath the veryweight of the excerpts. It is tempting to question the sense of publishing these oppressivechunks of quotations-whether it would not be best to publish only those texts written byBenjamin himself. These texts could have been easily arranged in a readable format, andthey would have yielded a poignant collection of sparkling aphorisms and disturbingfragments. But this would have made it impossible to guess at the pluject attempted in thePassagen- Werk, such as the reader can discern it behind these quotations. BeI~amin'sintention was to bring together theory and materials, quotations and interpretation, in anew constellation compared to contemporary methods of representation. '\"nle quotationsand the materials would bear the full weight of the project; theory and interpretationwould have to withdraw in an ascetic manner. Bel~31nin isolated a \"central problem ofhistorical materialism,\" which he thought he could solve in the Passagell-Werk, n31nely:In what way is it possible to conjoin a heightened graphicness &lt;Anschaulichkeit&gt; tothe realization of the Marxist method? TIle first stage in this undertaking will be tocarryover the principle of montage into history. That is, to assemble large-scaleconstructions out of the smallest 311d most precisely cut components. Indeed, todiscover in the analysis of the small individual moment the crystal of the total event.(N2,6)6The components, the structural elements, are the countless quotations, and for dus reasonthey carmot be omitted. Once familiar with the architecture of the whole, the reader willbe able to read the excerpts without great difficulty and pinpoint in almost everyone thatelement which must have fascinated Bel~amin. TIle reader will also be able to specifywluch function an excerpt would have served in the global construction-how it nugbthave been able to become a ~~crystal\" whose sparkling light itself reflects the total event.The reader will, of course, have to draw on the ability to \"interpolate into the infilutesi-mally small;' as Benjamin defines the imagination in Einbalmstrasse (One-Way Street)'?"

Perhaps even thebuilding Benjamin did not manage to build will delineate itself before the imaginativelyspeculative eye in shadowy outlines.These shadows, which prevent us from making a surveyable, consistent drawing of thearchitecture, are often traceable to problems of a philological nature. The fragments,which are mostly short and often seem to abbreviate a thought, only rarely allow us toglimpse how Benjamin planned to link them. He would often first write down ideas,pointed scribbles. It is impossible to detennine whether he plalmed to retain them in thecourse of his work. Some theoretical notes contradict each other; others al'e hardlycompatible. Moreover, many of Benjamin's texts are linked with quotations, and the mereinterpretation of those citations cannot always be separated from Benjarnin's mvn posi-tion. Therefore, to assist the reader in finding his bearings in the labyrinth this volumepresents, I shall briefly sketch the essentials of Benjamin's intentions in his Passagen-Werk,point out the theoretical nodes of his project, and try to approach explication of some ofits central categories.The Passagen-Werk is a building with two completely different floor plans, each belongingto a particular phase of the work. During the first phase, from about mid-1927 to the fallof 1929, Benjalnin planned to write an essay entitled \"PariseI' Passagen: Eine dialektischeFeerie\" (paris Arcades: A Dialectical Fairyland).8 His earliest references to it in letterscharacterize the project as a continuation of One-Way Street (Letters, 322), though Ben-jamin meant a continuation less in terms of its aphoristic form than in the specific kind ofconcretization he attempted there: \"this extreme concreteness which made itself felt therein some instances-in a children's game, a building, and a situation in life \"-should nowbe captured \"for an epoch\" (Letters, 348). BeI~amin's original intention was a philosophi-cal one and would remain so for all those years: \"putting to the test\" {die Probe az!/dasExempeO \"to what extent you can be 'concrete' in historical-philosophical contexts\" (Let-ters, 333). He tried to represent the nineteenth century as \"commentary on a reality')(0° ,9), rather than construing it in tlle abstract. We can put together a kind of \"catalogueof themes\" from the \"First Sketches\" about the Passagen-Werk. The catalogue shows uswhat the work was supposed to treat at this level: streets and wal'ehouses, panoramas,world exhibitions, types of lighting, fashion, advertising and prostitution, collectors, theflaneur and the gambler, boredom. Here the arcades themselves are only one themeamong many. They belong to tllose urban phenomena that appeared in the early nine-teenth century, witll the emphatic claim of the new, but they have meanwhile lost theirfunctionality. Benjamin discovered the signaulre of the early modern in the ever morerapid obsolescence of the inventions and innovations generated by a developing capital-ism's productive forces. He wanted to recover that feature from the appeal-ances of theunsightly, intentione recta, the physiognomic way: by showing rags, as a montage of trash(0°,36). In One-1iVcly Street his thinking had similarly lost itself in the concrete and partiCll-lar and had tried to wrest his secret directly, without any theoretical mediation. Such asurrender to singular Being is the distinctive feature of this thinking as such. It is notaffected by the rattling mechanisms of undergraduate philosophy, with its transcendentaltablets of commandments and prohibitions. Rather, it limits itself to the somewhat limit-less pursuit of a kind of gentle empirical experience\" (ftlnjJirie). Like Goethe's Empirie, itdoes not deduce tlle essence behind or above the thing-it knows it in the things them-selves.'\"The Surrealists were the first to discover the material world characteristic of the nine-"

It is to that mode1TI mythology thatAragon devotes the preface to his Paysan de Parify while Breton's Nadja reaches up into itsartificial sky. In his essay \"Surrealism,') which he called an \"opaque folding screen placedbefore the Passagen- Werk\" (Letters, 348), Benjamin praised the Surrealists as \"the first toperceive the revolutionary energies that appear in the 'outmoded; in the first iron con-stnlCtions, the first factory buildings, the earliest photos, the objects that begin to beextinct, grand pianos in the salon, the dresses of five years ago, fashionable restaurantswhen the vogue has begun to ebb from them.\"g This stratum of material, the alluvium ofthe recent past, also pertains to the Passagen-Werk.Just as Aragon, sauntering through thePassage de POpcra, was pulled by a vagw~ de rEves into strange, unglimpsed realms of theReal, so Benjamin wanted to submerge himself in hitherto ignored and scoDled reaches ofhistory and to salvage what no One had seen before him.TIle nearly depopulated aquariumllUlllaiu) as Aragon described the Passage de 1'0perain 1927, two years after it had been sacrificed to the completion of the inner circle ofboulevards-the ruins of yesterday, where today's riddles are solved-was mmlatched inits influence on the Passagen-Werk (see Letters, 488). Benjamin kept quoting the lueurglauque of Aragon's arcades: the light that objects are immersed in by dreams, a light thatmakes them appear strange and vivid at the same time. If the concept of the concreteformed one pole ofBel~amin's theoretical armature, then the Surrealist theory of dreamsmade up the other. TIle divagations of the first Arcades \"sketch)) take place in the field oftension between concretization and the dream. to TIrrough the dream, the early Surrealistsdeprived empirical reality of all its power; they maltreated empirical reality and its pur-posive rational organization as the mere content of dreams whose language can be onlyindirectly decoded. By turning tlle optics of the dream toward the waking world, onecould bring to birth the concealed, latent thoughts slumbering in that world's womb.Bel~amin wanted to proceed similarly with the representation of history, by treating thenineteenth-century world of things as if it were a world of dreamed things. Under capital-ist relationships of production, history could be likened to the unconscious actions of thedreaming individual, at least insofar as history is man-made, yet without consciousness ordesign, as if in a dream. \"In order to understand the arcades from the ground up, we sinkthem into the deepest stratum of the dream\" (FO,34). If the dreanl model is applied to thenineteenth century, then it will strip the era of its completeness, of that aspect that is goneforever, of what has literally become history. TIle means of production and way of lifedominant in tllat period were not only what they had been in their tiTne and place;Bel~alnin also saw the image-making imagination of a collective unconscious at work inthem. TImt imagination went beyond its historical limits in the dream and actuallytouched the present, by transferring \"the thoroughly fluctuating situation of a conscious-ness each time manifoldly divided between waking and sleeping,\" which he had discov-ered in psychoanalysis, \"from the individual to the collective\" (Go,27). Bel~aInin wantedto draw attention to the fact that architectonic constructions such as the aI'Cades owedtheir existence to and served the industrial order of production, while at the same timecontaining in themselves somedung unfulfilled, never to be fulfilled within the confines ofcapitalism-in tius case, the glass arclutecture of the future Benjamin often alludes to.~~Each epoch\" has a \"side turned toward dreaIlls, the cluld's side\" (F°,7). The scrutiny thisside of history was subjected to in Benjamin's observation was designed to \"liberate tileenormous energles oflustory ... that are slumbering in the ~once upon a time' of classicalhistorical narrative\" (0°,71).Almost concurrently with his first notes for tlle Passagen- WerkJ Benjamin included inIus \\'vritings many protocols of Ius own dreams; tlus was also when he began to experi-"

Both represented attempts to break the fixations and the encmstationsin which thinking and its object, subject and object, have been frozen under the pressureof industrial productionY In dreams as in narcotic intoxication, Benjamin watched \"aworld of particular secret affinities\" reveal itself, a world in which things enter into lIthemost contradictory communication\" and in which they could display Ilindefinite affini-ties\" (A°,4-5). Intoxication and the dream seemed to urllock a realm of experiences inwhich the Id still communicated mimetically and corporeally with things. Ever since hisearlier philosophical explorations, Benjamin sought a concept of experience that wouldexplode the limitations set by Kallt and regain \"the fullness of the concept of experienceheld by earlier philosophers,\" which should restore the experiences of theology.12 But theexperiences of the Surrealists taught him that it was a matter not of restoring theologicalexperience but of transporting it into the profane:These experiences are by no means limited to dreams, hours of hashish eating oropium smoking, It is a cardinal error to believe that, of \"Surrealist experiences;' weknow only the religious ecstasies or the ecstasies of dnlgs .... But the uue, creativeovercoming of religious illumination certainly does not lie in narcotics. It resides in aprqfone illumination, a materialistic, anthropological inspiration to which hashish,opium, or whatever else can give a preliminary lesson. (SUI, 2:208-209)Benjamin wanted to carry such profane illuminations into history by acting as an inter-preter of the dreallls of the nineteenth-century world of things. The epistemic intentionmanifest here seems to fit in vvith the context of Benjalnin's soon-to-be-formulated theoryof mimetic ability, which is, at its core, a theory of experience. 13 The dleory holds thatexperience rests on the ability to produce and perceive similarities-an ability dlat under-went significallt change in the course of species history. In the begimling a sensuous,qualitative type of behavior of mcn toward things, it later transformed itself phylogeneti-cally into a faculty for apperceiving nonsensuous similarities, which Benjamin identifiedas the achievements of lallguage and writing, Vis-a.-vis abstracting cognition, his conceptof experience wanted to maintain immediate contact -widl mimetic behavior. He wasconcerned about \"palpable knowledge\" (gifiihltes Wissen), which \"not only feeds on thesensory data taking shape before his eyes, but Call very well possess itself of abstractknowledge-indeed, of dead facts-as something experienced and lived through\" (eO,I),Images take the place of concepts-the enigmatic and vexing dre&lt;uu images which hide allthat falls through the coarse mesh of semiotics-and yet dlose images alone balance theexertions of cognition, The nineteenth-century language of images represents that cen-tury's \"deepest level of slcep\" (Go,27)-a sleep that should be awakened by the Passagen-Werk.Benjamin knew that tIns motif of awakening separated him fro111 the Surrealists, Theyhad tried to abolish the line of demarcation between life and art, to shut off poetry inorder to live writing or write life. For the eaTly Surrealists, both dream and reality wouldunravel to a dreamed, um-eal Reality, from which no way led back to contemporarypraxis and its demands. Bel~annn criticized Aragon for \"persisting within the realm ofdreams\" alld for allowing mythology to I'remain\" -with him (HO,l7). Aragon's mythologyremains mere mythology, unpenetrated by reason, Surrealist imagery evens out the differ-ences separating Now from Then; instead of bringing the past into the present, it drivesIlthings back into the distance again\" and remains bound, Ilin the historical sphere, [to] aromantic distance\" (CO,S). Benjamin, on the odler hand, wanted \"to [bring] things near,\"to allow them to \"step into our lives\" (1°,2). What linked his methods to Surrealist ones,"

According to Benjannl1,the images of dreaming and awakening from the dream are related as expression is relatedto interpretation. He hoped that the images, once interpreted, would dissolve the spelLBe~ annn' s concept of awakening means the \"genuine liberation from an epoch\" (hO,3), inthe double sense of Hegel's Alifhebung: the nineteenth century would be transcended inthat it would be preserved, \"rescued\" for the present. Benjamin defines \"the new, thedialectical method of doing history\" in these words: \"with the intensity of a dreaIn, to passthrough what has been (dar Geweselle), in order to experience the present as the wakingworld to which the dream refers\" (F°,6). TIlls concept is based on a mystical conception ofInstory that Benjamin was never to abandon, not even in his late theses \"On the Conceptof History?' Every present ought to be synchronic with certain moments of history, just asevery past becomes \"legible\" only in a certain epoch-\"namely, the one in which human-ity, nlbbing its eyes, recognizes just this particular dream unage as such. It is at thismoment that the historian takes up , , . the task of dream interpretation\" (N4,1), Tow3Tdthis end, we need not a dragging of the past UltO the mythological, but, on the contrary, a\"dissolution of 'mythology' Ul the space of history\" (H°,l7). Benjamin demanded a \"con-crete, materialist meditation on what is nearest\" (das Ndc/zste); he was interested \"only inthe presentation of what relates to us, what conditions us\" (CO ,5). In this way the Instorianshould no longer try to enter the past; radler, he should allow the past to enter his life. A\"pathos of nearness\" should replace the vanishing \"empathy\" (1°,2). For the historian,past objects and events would not then be fixed data, an unchangeable given, becausedialectical thinking \"ransacks them, revolutionizes them, turns them upside down\"(D°,4); this is what must be accomplished by awakening from the dream of the nineteenthcentury. That is why for Bel~amin the \"effort to awaken from a dream\" represents \"thebest example of dialectical reversal\" (D°,7),TIle key to what may have been Benjamin's intention while working on the first phaseof the PasJtlgen-Werk may be found Ul the sentence, \"Capitalism was a natural phenome-non with which a new dream-filled sleep came over Europe, and, through it, a reactivationof mytincal forces\" (KIa,8), Benjamin shares his project) the desire to ulVestigate capital-ism, with historical materialism, from which he may well have appropriated the project inthe [rrst place. But the concepts he uses to define capitalism-nature, dream, and myth-originate from the terminology of his ovvI1 metaphysically and theologically inspiredthought. 'nle key concepts of the young Benjamin's philosophy of history center arounda critique of myth as the ordained heteronomous) which kept man banished Ul dumbdependence throughout prehistory aIld which has since survived in the most dissimilarforms, both as unmediated violence and in bourgeois jurisprudence. H The critique ofcapitalism in the first Arcades sketch remaulS a critique of myth, sUlCe in it the nineteenthcentury appears as a domain where \"only madness has reigned until now.\" \"But))) Ben-jannll adds, \"every ground must at some point have been turned over by reason, musthave been cleared of the undergrowth of delusion and myth. This is to be accomplishedhere for the tenain of the nineteenth century\" (Go,13). His interpretation recognizesforms still unlnstorical, still unprisoned by myth, forms that are only preparing dlem-selves, in such an interpretation, to awaken from myth and to take away its power.Benjamin identifies them as the dominant forms of consciousness and the imagery ofincipient high capitalism: the \"sensation of the newest and most modern,)) as well as the"

He speaks in direct theologicalterms in his interpretation of the modern as \"the time of hell\":What matters here is that the face of the world, the colossal head, precisely in whatis newest never itself changes-that this \"newesC' remains in all respects the same.This constitutes the eternity of hell and the sadisCs delight in irmovation. To deter-mine the totality of traits which derme this \"modernity\" is to represent hell, (Go,17)Since it is a \"commentary on a reality,\" which sinks into the historical and interprets it asit would a text, theology was called upon to provide the \"scientific mainstay\" of thePassagen-Werk (0°,9), though at the same time politics was to retain its \"primacy overhistory\" (hO ,2). At the time of the first Arcades sketch, Benjamin was concerned less with amediation of theological and political categories than with their identity. In this he wasvery much like Emst Bloch in Geist der Utopie (Spirit of Utopia), which he explicitly tookas his model. He repeatedly had recourse to Blochian concepts to characterize his ownintentions, as in \"fashion inheres in the darkness of dle lived moment, but in the collectivedarkness\" (O°,ll).Just as for Bloch the experiencing individual has not yet achievedmastery over himself at the moment of experiencing, for Benjamin the historical phenom-ena remain opaque, unilluminated for the dreaming collective. In Bloch's opinion, indi-vidual experience is always experience of the immediate past; in the same way,Ber~arnin's interpretation of the present refers to the recent past: action in the presentmeans awakening from the dream of history, an \"explosion\" of what has been, a revolu-tionary Ulrn. He was convinced that \"the whole set of issues with which this project isconcerned\" would be \"illuminated in the process of the proletariaes becoming consciousof itself\" (0° ,68). He did not hesitate to interpret these facts as part of the preparation forthe proletarian revolution. \"The dialectical penetration and aCUlalization of former con-texts puts the truth of all present action to the test\" (0°,5). It is not the action itself but itstheory that is at stake here. TIus defines the task of the historian as \"rescuing\" the past or,as BeI~amin formulated it with another concept taken from Bloch, \"awakening a not-yet-conscious knowledge of what has been)) (H°,17) by applying the \"theory of not-yet-conscious knowing ... to the collective in its various epochs\" (0°,50). At this stage,Bel~a111in conceived of the Passagen- Werk as a mystical reconstitution: dialectical thinkinghad the task of separating the future-laden, \"positive\" element from the backward \"nega-tive\" element, after which I'a new partition had to be applied to this initially excluded,negative component so that, by a displacement of the angle of vision ... , a positiveelement emerges anew in it too-something different from that previously signified. Andso on, ad infinitum, until the entire past is brought into the present in a historical apocatas-tasis\" (Nla,3). In this way, the nineteenth century should be brought into the presentwithin the Passagen-l#rk. Bel~amin did not think revolutionary praxis should be allowedat any lesser price. For him revolution was, in its lughest fonn, a liberation of the past,which had to demonstrate \"the indestructibility of the highest life in all things\" (0°,1). Atthe end of the 1920s, theology and communism converged in Benjal1un's thought. TIlemetaphysical, lustorical-philosophical, and theological sources that had nurtured both hisesoteric early writings and his great aesthetic works until Ui:prung des deutJcllell Trauer-sjJie/s (Origin of the German Trauerspiel) were still flowing and would also nurture dlePassagen-Werk.'\"TIle Passagen-Werk was supposed to become all of that, and it becaIne none of that-toecho a famous phrase ofBel~amin's (DO,6).

Retrospectively, he placed responsibility on problems of representation:the \"rhapsodic nature\" of the work, which he had already announced in the first sketch'ssubtitle, \"a dialectical fairyland\" (Letters, 488). \"'The \"illicit 'poeticm fonnulation he thenthought he was obliged to use was irreconcilable with a book that was to have \"ourgeneration's decisive historical interests as its object\" (Scholem Letters) 165). Benjaminbelieved that only historical materialism could safeguard those interests; the aporias heencountered while composing the Passagen-Werk) then, undoubtedly culminated in theproject's position in relation to Marxist theory. Though Benjamin professed his commit-ment to Communist party politics to begin with, he still had to convince himself of thenecessity to proceed from a political creed to the theoretical study of Marxism, which hethought could be appropriated for his purposes even prior to his actual study. His inten-tion was to secure the Passagen- Werk \"against all objections ... provoked by metaphys-ics\"; \"the whole mass of thought, originally set into motion by metaphysics;' had to besubjected to a \"recasting process\" which would allow tlle author to \"face with equanimitythe objects orthodox Marxism might mobilize against the method of the work\" (Letters,489). Benjamin traced the end of his \"blithely archaic philosophizing, inlprisoned bynature,\" which had been the basis of the \"romantic form\" and the \"rhapsodic naivete\" ofthe first sketch, to conversations with Adorno and Horkheimer that he characterized as\"historic\" (Letters, 488-489). These took place in September or October 1929, in Frank-lint and Konigstein. In all probabilily, both Horkheimer and Adorno insisted in dis-cussions of the submitted texts-mainly the \"Early Drafts\" published with thePassagen- Werl{-that it was iInpossible to speak sensibly about the nineteenth centurywithout considering Marx's analysis of capital; it is entirely possible that Benjamin, whoat that time had read hardly anything by Marx, was influenced by such a suggestion. is Bethat as it may, Benjamin's letter to Scholem of January 20, 1930, contains tlle statementthat he would have to study certain features of both Hegelian philosophy and Capital inorder to complete his project (Letters, 359). Ber~amin had by no means concluded suchstudies when he returned to the Passagen-Werk four years later. The \"new face\" (5:1103)the work unveiled, due not a little to Benjamin's political experiences in exile, revealeditself in an emphatic recourse to social history, which had not been wholly relinquished inthe first sketch but which had been concealed by that sketch's surrealist intentions. Noneof the old motifs were abandoned, but the building was given stronger foundations.Among the themes added were Haussmann's influence, the struggles on the barricades,railways, conspiracies, cornpag'llonnage) social movements, the Stock Exchange, economichistory, the Commune, the history of sects, and the Ecole Poly technique; moreover,Benjamin began assembling excerpts on Marx, Fourier, and Saint-Simon. This thematicexpansion hardly meant that Benjamin was about to reserve a chapter for each theme (henow planned to write a book instead of an essay). TIle book's subject was now defIned as'~the fate of art in the nineteenth century\" (Letters, 517) and thus seemed more narrowlyconceived than it had been. '111at should not be taken too literally, however: the 1935expose, after all, in which Benjamin most clearly delineates his intentions in his work'ssecond stage, still lists every theme the Passagen-Werk was to treat from the outset: ar-cades, panoramas, world exhibitions, interiors, and the streets of Paris. This expose's title,\"Paris, the Capital of the Nineteenth Century;' remained the definitive title and wasappropriated for another expose-a French prospectus-in 1939. This prospectus con-tains a decisive reference to \"the new and far-reaching sociological perspectives\" of thesecond sketch.

In1935 the \"unfolding of this concept\" would \"constitute the center\" of the projected work(Scholem Letters, 159), and by 1938 the \"basic categories\" of the Passagm-Werk would\"converge in the determination of the fetish character of commodities\" (5:1166), Thisnotion surfaces only once in the first sketch (0°,38); it was then by no means clear thatcommodity fetishism was destined to form the central schema for the whole project.\"When Benjamin wrote the fiTSt expose in 1935, he was probably still unfamiliar with therelevant discussion in Marx's writings, He apparently only began to \"look around, , , inthe first volume of Capital\" after completing the expose (5:1122). He was fmnihar with thetheory of commodity fetishism mainly in Lukac's version; like many other left-wingintellectuals of his generation, Benjamin largely owed his Marxist competency to thechapter on reification in Lukacs's Hist01Y and Class Consciousness.Benjamin wished to treat culture in dle era of high capitalism like Lukac's translationback into philosophy of the economic fact of commodity fetishism, as well as his applica-tion of the category of reilication to the antinomies of bourgeois thought. Marx showedthat capitalist production's abstraction of value begets an ideological consciousness, inwhich labor's social character is reflected as objective, thing-like characteristics of theproducts of that labor. Benjamin recognized the same ideological consciousness at work inthe then-dominant \"reified conception of culture:' which obfuscated the fact dlat \"thecreations of the human mind ... owe not just their origin, but also the ways in which theyhave been handed down, to a continuing social labor\" (5:1255). The fate of nineteenth-century culture lay precisely in its connllodity character, which Berqamin thereuponrepresented in \"cultural values\" as phantasmagoria. Phantasmagoria: a Blendwerk, a decep-tive TInage designed to dazzle, is already the commodity itself, in which the exchangevalue or value-form hides the usc value. Phantasmagoria is the whole capitalist produc-tion process, which constitutes itself as a natural force against the people who carry it out.For Bel~amin, cultural phantasmagorias express \"the ambiguity peculial' to the socialrelations and products of this epoch\" (Expose of 1935, section V). In Marx, the sameambiguity dermes \"the economic world of capitalism\": an ambiguity \"exemplified quiteclearly in the machines which aggravate exploitation rather than alleviate the human lot\"(1&lt;.3,5), Tbe concept of phantasmagoria that Bel~amin repeatedly employs seems to bemerely another term for what Marx called cOllullodity fetishism, Benjamin's term caneven be found in Marx's writings: in Capitars first chapter (on fetishism), in the famouspassage about the ~~definite social relation\" which molds labor under capitalist conditionsof production, that very relation is said to \"assume ... the phantasmagoric form of arelation between things\" for the people concerned. lii Marx had in mind the circumstancesof the bourgeois economy's \"necessal'ily false\" consciousness, which is no less false forbeing necessary, Bel~amin's interest in culture was less for its ideological content, how-ever, whose depth is uneardled TIl ideology critique, than for its surface or exterior, whichis both promising and deceptive, \"TIle creations and life-styles that were mainly condi-tioned by cOIIlmodity production and which we owe to the previous century\" are ~'sensuDusly transfigured in their immediate presence\" (5:1256). Bel~amin was interested in thatimmediate presence; the secret he was tracking in the Passag,-en-Werk is a secret that comesto appear, The \"luster with which the commodity-producing society surrounds itself\"(5:1256) is phantasmagorical-a luster that hardly has less to do with the \"beautifulappearance\" of idealist aesthetics than with commodity fetishism, Phantasmagorias al'ethe \"centuris magic inlages\" (1:1153); they are the WztJIschbildClj the wish symbols orideals, by which that collective tried \"both to overCOIIle and to transfigure the immaturityof the social product and the inadequacies in the social organization of production\""

    "text": "(Expose of 1935, section I). To begin with, the phantasmagoria seems to have a transfigur-ing function: world exhibitions, for example, transform the exchange value of commodi~ties by fading, as in a film, from the abstractness of their valuation. Similarly, the collectortransfigures things by divesting them of their commodity character. And in this same way,iron construction and glass architecture are transfigured in the arcades becallse \"thecentury could not match the new technical possibilities with a new social order\" (5:1257).AI:. Benjamin in late 1937 came across Auguste BIanqui's L'Eterniti par les astres-a cosmo-logical phantasmagoria written by the revolutionary while in prison-he reencounteredhis own speculation about the nineteenth century as Hades. The semblance character(Scheinluifle) of all that is new and that the century liked to show off as modern parexcellence was consummated in its highest concept, that of progress, which Blanquidenounced as a Ilphantasmagoria of history,\" as \"something so old it predates thinking,which struts about in the clothes of the New,\" as the etenlal recun-ence of the same, inwhich mankind figures lIas one of the danmed\" (5:1256). Bel~amin learned from Blanquithat the phantasmagoria embraced \"the most bitter criticism;' the harshest indictment ofsociety\" (5:1256-1257). TIle transfiguring aspects of phantasmagoria change to enlighten-ment, into the insight \"that mankind will remain under the power of mythical fear as longas phantasmagoria has a place in that fear (5:1256). The century always transcends the\"old social order\" in its cultural phantasmagoria. As llwish symbols,\" the arcades andinteriors, the exhibition halls and panoramas are llresidue of a dream world.\" They arepart of BIochian dreaming ahead, anticipating the future: IIEvery epoch, in fact, not onlydreams the one to follow, but, in dreaming, precipitates its awakening. It bears it&lt;; endwithin itself.\" Insofar as dialectical thinking tries to define as well as to expedite this end ofdecaying bourgeois culture, it became for Bel~amin the llorgan of historical awakening\"(Expose of1935, section VI, end).lIThe property appertaining to the commodity as its fetish character attaches as well tothe commodity-producing society-not as it is in itself, to be sure, but more as it repre-sents itself and thinks to understand itself whenever it abstracts ii'om the fact that itproduces precisely commodities\" (X13a). That was hardly Marx's opinion. He identifiesthe fetish character of the commodity through the fact that the features of man's laborap/Jear to hun as what they are: ~Ias material relations betvveen persons and social relationsbetvveen things.\" 17 The analysis of capital establishes the quid pro quo of commodityfetishism as objective, not as a phantasmagoric. Marx would necessarily have rejected thenotion that the conmlodity-producing society might be able to abstract from the fact thatit produces con'lllOditics in any other way than by really ceasing to produce coml11oditiesin the transition to a higher social formation. It is not difficult-though also not veryproductive-to point out Bel~amin's miscomprehensions of Marxist theory.Bel~amin showed little interest in a Marxist theory of art, which he considered Ilonemoment swaggering, and the next scholastic\" (N4a,2). He valued three short sentences byProust more highly than most of what existed in the field of materialist analysis (K3,4).TIle majority of Marxist art theorists explain culture as the mere reflection of economicdevelopment; Bel~amin refused to join them. He viewed the docb:ine of aesthetic reflec-tion as already undercut by Marx's remark tTh'lt lithe ideologies of the superstructurereflect relations in a false and distorted mam1er.\" Benjamin followed this remark with aquestion:If the infrastructure in a certain way (in the materials of thought and experience)determines the superstnlcture, but if such determination is not reducible to simplereflection, then how should it be characterized'?

The economic conditions under whichsociety exists are expressed in the superstructure, precisely as, with the sleeper, anoverfull stomach finds not its reflection but its expression in the contents of dreams,which, from a causal point of view, it may be said to \"condition.\" (K2,5)BeI~amin did not set out according to ideology critique;18 radler, he gave way to thenotion of materialist physiognomies, which he probably understood as a complement, oran extension, of Marxist theory. Physiognomies infers the interior from the exterior; itdecodes the whole from the detail; it represents dIe general in the particular. Nominal-istically speaking, it proceeds from the tangible object; inductively it commences in thereahn of the intuitive. The Passagen.-Werk \"deals fundamentally with the expressive char-acter of the earliest industrial products, the earliest industrial architecture, the earliestmachines, but also dIe earliest department stores, advertisements, and so on\" (Nla,7). Inthat expressive character, Benjamin hoped to locate what eluded the immediate grasp: theSign.atu}~ the mark, of the nineteenth century. He was interested in the \"thread of expres-sion\": \"the expression of the economy in its culture will be presented, not the economicorigins of culture\" (Nla,6). Benjamin's trajectory from the first to the second sketch of thePassagen-Werk documents his efforts to safeguard his work against the demands of his tori-cal materialism; in this way, motifs belonging to metaphysics and theology survivedundamaged in the physiognomic concept of the epoch's closing stage, 1'0 describe theexpression of economics in culture was an attempt \"to grasp an economic process asperceptible Ur~phenomenon, from out of which proceed all manifestations of life in thearcades (and, accordingly, in the nineteenth century)\" (Nla,6).

Physiognomic thought was assigned the task of \"recognizing the monuments ofthe bourgeoisie as ruins even before they have crumbled\" (Expose of 1935, section VI,end).The prolegomena to a materialist physiognomies that can be gleaned from the Pas-Jagen.-Werk counts among Benjamin's most prodigious conceptions. It is the program-matic harbinger of that aesthetic theory which Marxism has not been able to develop tothis day. Whether Benjamin's realization of rus program was capable of fi.llfilling itspromise, whether his physiognomies was equal to its materialist task, could have beenproven only by the actual composition of the PasJagen- JiVerk itself.Modified concepts of history and of the writing of history are the link between bothArcadeJ sketches. Their polemical barbs are aimed at the nineteenth-century notion ofprogress. \"Vith the exception of Schopenhauer (by no coincidence, his objective worldbears the name \"phantasmagoria\"), idealist philosophers had turned progress into the\"signature of historical process as a whole\" (N13)) and by doing so had deprived it of itscritical and enlighteillilent functions. Even Marx's tnlst in the unfolding of the productiveforces hypostatized the concept of progress, and it must have appeal\"ed untenable toBenjamin in light of the experience of the twentieth century. Similarly, the political praxisof the worker's movement had forgotten that progress in terms of proficiency and infor-mation does not necessarily mean progress for humanity itself--and that progress in thedomination of nature corresponds to societal regress. 21 In the first ArcadeJ sketch Ben-jamin already demanded \"a philosophy of history that at all points has overcome theideology of progress\" (0°,5), one such as he later worked out in the historical-philosophi-cal theses. TIlere the image of history reminds the reader more of Ludwig Klages's lethaljuggling with archetypal images (UrbildCl) and phantoms than of the dialectic of the forcesand the relations of production, It is that Angel of History who appears in one of thetheses as an allegory of the historical materialist (in Benjamin's sense)22 and who sees allhistory as a catastrophe \"which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in frontof rus feet\" (Illuminations, p. 259). The Angel abolishes all categories which until d,enhave been used for representing history: this materialist sees the \"everything 'gradual'about becoming\" as refuted, and \"development\" is shown to be only \"seeming') (1'°,6;Kl,3). But more than anything else, he denounces the \"establishment of a continuity\"(N9a,5) in history) because the only evidence of th:\"1t continuity is that of horror, and theAngel has to do with salvation and redemption. TIle Passagen- JiVerk was supposed tobring nothing less than a \"Copernican revolution\" of historical perception (Fo)7; K1)1-3),Past history would be grounded in the present, analogous to Kanes epistemologicalgrounding of objectivity in the depths of the subject. The frrst revolution occuncd in therelationship in which subject and object, present and past meet in historical perception:Fonnerly it was thought that a fixed point had been found in \"what has been;) andone saw the present engaged in tentatively concentrating the forces of knowledge onthis ground, Now this relation is to be overturned, and what has been is to becomethe dialectical reversal-the irnlption of awakened consciousness. Politics attainsprimacy over history. The facts become something that just now first happened tous, first struck us; to establish them is the affair of memory, (K1,2)The historical line of vision no longer falls from the present back onto history; instead ittravels from history forward. Be~jamin tried to \"recognize today's life, today's forms inthe life and in the appaTently secondary, lost forms\" of the nineteenth century (N1,U).Our contemporary interest in a historical object seems \"itself preformed in that object,"

The object ofhistory goes on changing; it becomes \"historical\" (in this word's emphatic sense) onlywhen it becomes topical in a later period. Continuous relationships in tllIle, with whichhistory deals, are superseded in Benjamin's thought by constellations in which the pastcoincides with the present to such an extent that the past achieves a \"Now\" of its \"recog-nizability:' Benjamin developed this \"Now of Recognizability;' which he sometilnes re-ferred to as his theory of knowledge (5:1148), from a double frontal position against bothidealism and positivistic historicism. VVhile the latter tried to move the historical narratorback into the past, so that he could comprehend \"emphatically\" (solely from within) thewhole of the Then, which filled \"homogeneous, empty time\" as a mere \"mass of data\"(Illuminations) p. 264), idealist constructions of history, on the other hand, usurped theprospect of the future and posited in history the existence of the natural plan of a process,which runs on autonomously and can, in principle, never be completed. Both relegate\"everything about history that, from the very beginning, has been untimely, sorrowful,unsuccessful\" (TrauerJPiel) p.166) to forgetting. TIle object of that materialist historicalnatrative Benjamin wanted to try out in the Passagen- Werk would be precisely whathistory started but did not carry out. That the lineaments of the past are first detectableafter a certain period is not due to the historian's whim; it bespeaks an objective historicalconstellation:History is the object of a construct whose site is not homogeneous, empty time, buttime filled by now-time fJetztzeit]. Thus, to Robespierre ancient Rome was a pastcharged with now-time, which he blasted out of the continuum of history. TheFrench Revolution viewed itself as Rome incanlate. It quoted ancient Rome. (Illumi-Ilations, p. 263)Bel~arnin wished to continue along tlus line in the Passagen-Werk. The present wouldprovide the text of the book; history, the quotations in that text. \"To VVTite history ...means to cite history\" (Nll,3).Benjamin's Copernican revolution of historical intuition also (and above all) meant thatthe traditional concept of truth was to be turned on its head:Resolute refusal of the concept of \"timeless tnlth\" is in order. Nevertheless) truth isnot-as Marxism would have it-a merely contingent function of knowing, but isbound to a nucleus of time lying hidden witlun the knower and the known alike.This is so tnle tllat the etenlal, in any case, is far more the ruffle on a dress thansome idea.

Suchan image is afforded by the commodity per se: as fetish\" (Expose of 1935, section V),TIIese statements drew the resolute criticism of Adorno, who could not concede that thedialectical image could be \"the way in which fetishism is conceived in the collectiveconsciousness;' since conunodity fetishism is not a ((fact of consciousness\" (Letters, 495).Under the influence of AdOlTIO's objections, BeI~amin abandoned such lliles of thought;the corresponding passages in his 1939 expose were dropped as no longer satisfactory totheir author (see 5:1157). By 1940, in the theses \"On the Concept of History,\" \"dialecticat a standstill') seems to function almost like a heuristic principle, a procedure that enablesthe historical materialist to maneuver his objects:A historical materialist cannot do without the notion of a present which is not atransition) but in which time stands still and has come to a stop.

In this structure he recognizes the sign of a messianiccessation of happening, or, put differently, a revolutionary chance in dIe fight for theoppressed past. (Illuminations, pp. 264-265)In fact, Bel~amin's thinking was invariably in dialectical linages. As opposed to theMarxist dialectic, which \"regards every . . . developed social form as in fluid move-ment;' 24 Benjamin's dialectic tried to halt the flow of the movement, to grasp eachbecomlilg as beilig. In Adorno's words, Benjamin's philosophy \"appropriates the fetish-ism of commodities for itself: everything must metamorphoze into a clling in order tobreak the catastrophic spell of things.\"25 His philosophy progressed imagistically, in that itsought to ((read\" historical social phenomena as if they were natural llistorical ones.Images became dialectical for this philosophy because of the historical index of everysingle image, l~In the dialectical image\" of this philosophy, \"what has been within aparticular epoch is always simultaneously lwhat has been from time immemorial'\" (N4,1).By so being, it remained rooted in the mythical.

The particular revolutionary opportunity of each historical mo-ment is confIrmed for the revolutionary thinker by the political situation. But it is noless confirmed for him by the power this moment has to open a very particular,heretofore closed chanlber of the past. Entry into this chalnber coincides exactlywith political action. (1:1231)Political action, \"no matter how destnlctive,\" should always \"reveal itself as messianic\"(1 :1231), Benjamin's historical materialism can hardly be severed from political meSSial'l-ism. In a late note, perhaps written under the shock of the Hitler-Stalin pact, Benjaminformulated as \"the experience of our generation: that capitalism will not die a naturaldeath\" (Xlla,3). In that case, the onset of revolution could no longer be awaited with thepatience of Marx; rather, it had to be envisaged as the eschatological end of history: \"theclassless society is not the ultimate goal of progress in history but its rupture, so oftenattempted and finally brought about (1:1231). Myth is liquidated in the dialectical imageto make room for the \"dream of a thing\" (1:1174); this dream is the dialectic at a standstill,the piecing together of what history has broken to bits (see Illuminations) p. 257), thetikkun of the Lurian Kabbalah,27 Benjamin did quote the young Mal'x, who wanted toshow \"that the world has long possessed the drealll of a thing that, made conscious, itwould possess in reality\" (N5a,l). But for the interpreter of dialecticalllllages, true realitycannot be lluen-ed from existing reality, He undertook to represent tlIe imperative alId thefinal goal of reality as \"a preformation of the final goal ofhistoty\" (N5,3). The awakeningfrom myth would follow the messianic model of a history immobilized in redemption asthe historian of the Passagen-Werk had imagined it. In his dialectical images, the burstingof time coincides with lithe birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth\" (N3,1).Since the dialectical images belong III such a way to messianic time, or since they shouldat least let that time reveal itself as a :Bash of lightning, messianism is llltroduced as a kindof methodology of historical research-an adventtlresome undertaking if ever there wasone. \"'Tbe subject of historical knowledge is the struggling, oppressed class itself\" (Illumi-nations) p. 260); one may imagine the historian of the dialectic at a standstill as the heraldof that class, Bel~amin himself did not hesitate to call him \"a prophet turned backward,\"borrowing a phrase from Friem'ich Schlegel (1:1237): he did not dismiss the Old Testa-ment idea that prophecy precedes the Messiah, that the Messiah is dependent on proph-ecy. But Benjamin's historiographer is \"endowed with a weak messianic power, a power towhich the past has a claim.\" Tbe historian honors that claim when he captures that\"image of the past that is not recognized by the present as one of its own concerns\" andthus \"threatens to disappear ilTetrievably\" (Illuminations) pp. 256-257). Benjamin wasable to recognize only the mythical Ever-Same (I7Ilmergleiclze) III historical evolutions andwas unable to recognize progress, except as a Sprung-a \"tiger's leap into the pase' (Illumi-natioJlJ) p. 263), which was in reality a leap out of history and the entry of the messianickingdom, He tried to match this mystical conception of history with a version of dialecticsin which mediation would be totally eclipsed by reversal, in which atonement would haveto yield to criticism and destruction, His \"blasting\" the dialectical image \"out of thecontinuum of historical process\" (NIOa,3) was akin to that anarchistic impulse which triesto stop history during revolutions by lllstituting a new calendar, or by shooting at church"

The gaze, which exorcized images fromobjects blasted loose from time, is the Gorgon gaze at the )(lcies hippocratica of history;'the \"petrified primordial landscape\" of myth (Trauet:rpiel, p. 166). But in that mysticalmoment when past and present enter \"lightning-like\" into a constellation-when the trueunage of the past \"flashes\" in the \"now of its recognizabiliti' (N9,7)-that image becomesa dialectically reversing unage, as it presents itself from the messianic perspective, or (inmaterialistic terms) the perspective of the revolution.From this perspective of '~messianic time,\" Benjamin defined the present as catastrophe(1:1243), as the prolongation of that \"one single catastrophe\" which meets the AngelusNovus when he looks back on past history. It might appear as if Benjamin vvished toreintroduce the \"large hyphen between past and future,\"28 which was thought to beeradicated after Marx. Yet even Benjamin's late work does not fully forgo historicalreference. Henri :Focillon defined the classical in art as \"bonheur rajJl'de/' as the chairouachme of the Greeks, and Benjamin wanted to use that definition for his own concept ofmessianic standstill (see 1:1229). TIle dialectic at a standstill, the final coming to rest, theending of the historical dynamic which Hegel, following Aristotle, wished to ascribe tothe state, was, for Benjamin, prefigured only in 8Tt. A \"real definition\" of progress,therefore, could emerge only from the vantage pOUlt of an, as in the Passagen- Werll:In every true work of art there is a place where, for one who removes there, it blowscool like the wind of a coming dawn. From this it follows that art, which has oftenbeen considered refractory to every relation with progress, can provide its tnledefinition. Progress has its seat not in the continuity of elapsing time but in itsinterferences. (N9a,7)In dlis sense, it may even be possible to save that problematic definition from the firstexpose, accordulg to which in the dialecticalunage the mythical, Ur-historical experiencesof the collective unconscious \"engender, through interpenetration with what is new, theutopia\"-and that utopia \"has left its trace in a thousand conEgurations of life, fromenduring edifices to passing fashions\" (section I). Benjamin devised his dialectic at astandstill in order to make such traces visible, to collect the \"trash of history,\" and to\"redeem\" them for its end. He undertook the equally paradoxical and astonishing task ofpresenting history in the spirit of an anti-evolutionary understanding of history. As a\"messianic cessation of the event,\" it would have devolved upon the dialectic at a stand-still to bring home in the PaJsagen- Werk the very insight Benjamin had long assullilatedwhen he began that project: \"the profane ... although not itself a category of this [messi-anic] Kingdom, is at least a category, and one of the most applicable, of its quietestapproach.\" 29 Benjamin's concept of profane illumination would remain \"illuminated\" inthis way to the end; his materialist inspiration would be \"inspired\" in the same way, andhis materialism would prove theological in the same way, despite all \"recasting processes.\"Bel~am:in)s historical materialism was historically tnle only as the puppet, \"which enliststhe services of theology.\" Nevertheless, it was supposed to \"win\" (Illuminations, p. 253).One can be excused for doubting whether this intricate claim could ever be honored. Inthat case, the reader, who has patiently followed the topography of the Passagen- Werk,including all the detours and cul-de-sacs this edition does not veil, may think he is, in theend, faced with ruins rather than with vlTginal building materials. What Benjamin wroteabout German Trauerspiel however, holds true for tlle Passagen-Werk: namely, that \"in theruins of gTeat buildings the idea of the plan speaks more impressively than in lesserbuildings, however well preselved they are\" (Trauerspiel, p. 235).- Translated by Gary Smith and Andre Ldi:vere"

But 1 better keep my mind on the road, I said to myself, and try tofigure out Azema's directions on the little map.Here was the empty shed the mayor had mentioned, so we weren't lost ... not yet.Then we found the path with a slight turn to the left. And the huge rock he had described.A clearing! 'D1at must be it. We had made it, after ahnost three hours.This was about one third of dle total route, according to Azema. I don't remember it asbeing difficult. We sat down and rested for a while. BeI~amin stretched out on the grassand closed his eyes, and I thought it must have been tiring for him.We were ready to start the descent, but he didn't get up. \"Are you all right?\" 1 asked.\"1 am fine,\" he answered, \"you three go ahead.\"\"And you?'~~I am staying here. I am going to spend the night here, and you will join me in themorning.\"This was worse th311 I had expected. VVhat do 1 do now? All I can do is try and reasonwidl him. This was wild mountain territory, there could be dangerous animals. As amatter of fact, I knew that dlere were wild bulls. It was late September and he had nothingwith which to cover himself. There were smugglers around, and who knew what theymight do to him. He would have nothing to eat or drink. Anyhow, this was insane."

The goal was to cross the border so dmt he and his manuscriptwould not fall into the hands of the Gestapo. He had reached one third of this goal. If hehad to return to the village and then do the entire way again tomorrow, his heart wouldprobably give out. Ergo, he would stay.I sat down again and said: \"Then I too -will stai'He smiled. \"Will you defend me against your wild bulls, gnadige Frau?\"My staying would not be reasonable, he explained quietly. It was essential that I checkback widl Azema and that I get a good night's sleep. Only dlen would I be able to guidethe Gurlands back before sunrise -without possible error or delay, and continue to theborder.Of course, I knew all that. Above all, I had to get hold of some bread -widl0ut rationstamps, and perhaps some tomatoes and black-market ersatz marmalade, to keep us goingduring ilie day. I dlink I had only tried to shock Benjamin into abandoning his plan, butof course it hadn't worked.On the descent, I tried to concentrate on the road so that I would be able to find my wayin the dark the next monting. But my mind kept nagging: he shouldn't be up there alone,this is all wrong .... Had he plamled it this way all along? Or had ilie walk exhausted himso much that he had decided to stay only after we arrived? But there was this heavybriefcase that he had taken along. Were his survival instincts intact? If in danger, whatwould his peculiar way of reasoning tell him to do?During the winter, before France's surrender, my husband and Benjamin had beentogether in one of the camps where the French govenllIlent imprisoned the refugees fromNazi Germany-together -with the Nazis. They were at the Camp de Vernuche, close toNevers. In one of their conversations Benjamin, a heavy smoker, revealed that he had quitsmoking a few days ago. It was painful, he added. \"Wrong tinting,\" Hans told him. SeeingBenjamin's inability to handle \"the adversities of outer life which sometimes come ... likewolves\"l-at Vernuche all of life was adversity-Hans had become used to helping himcope.He now tried to show Benjamin that in order to tolerate crises and keep one's sanity,the fundamental rule was to look for gratifications, not punishments. Bel~amin ,mswered,\"I can bear the conditions in the camp only if I am forced to immerse my mind totally inan effort. '10 quit smoking requires this effort, and it will therefore save me.\"TIle next morning everything seemed to be going well. The danger of being seen by thepolice or customs guards was greatest when leaving the village and starting up dle foot-hills. Azema had insisted: start out before sunrise, mingle -with the vineyard workers onyour way up, don't carry anything except a musette, don't talk. That way the patrols can'tdistinguish you from the villagers. Mrs. Gurland and her young son, to whom I hadexplained these rules, carefully followed them, and I had no trouble finding the way.The closer we came to the clearing, the more tense I grew. Will BeI~amin be there?Will he be alive? My imagination started turning like a kaleidoscope.Finally. Here is the clearing. Here is old Benjamin. Alive. He sits up and gives us afriendly look. Then I stare at his face-what has happened? Those dark purple blotchesunder his eyes-could they be a symptom of a heart attack?He guessed why I stared. Taking off his glasses and wiping his face with a handker-"

The pads inside the ii'ames, see?111ey stain when they get damp.\"My heart stopped beating in my throat and slipped back down to where it belonged.From here on, the ascent was steeper. Also, we began to be repeatedly in doubt aboutwhich direction to take. To my surprise Benjamin was quite able to understand our littlemap, and to help me keep our orientation and stick to the right road.The word \"road\" became more and more sy:mbolic. There were stretches of a path, butmore often it became a hardly discernible trail among boulders-and then the steepvineyard which I will never forget.But first I have to explain what made this route so safe.Following the initial descent, the path ran parallel to the widely known \"official\" roadalong the crest of dIe mountain chain, which was quite passable. \"Our\" road-the RouteLiJter and an old, old smugglers' path-ran below and somewhat tucked inside theoverhang of the crest, out of the sight of the French border guards patrolling above. At afew points the two roads approached each other closely, and there we had to keep silent.Benjamin walked slowly and with an even measure. At regular intervals-I believe itwas ten minutes-he stopped and rested for about one minute. Then he went on, at thesame steady pace. He had calculated and worked this out during the night, he told me:\"With this timing I will be able to make it to the end. I rest at regular intervals-I mustrest bifore I become exhausted. Never spend yourself:1What a strange man. A crystal-clear mind; unbending inner strength; yet, a wooly-headed bungler.The nature of his strength, Walter Benjamin once wrote, is \"patience, conquerable bynothing.\" 2 Reading tlns years later, I saw him again walking slowly, evenly along themountain path, and the contraructions within him lost some of their absurdity.Mrs. Gurland's son, Jose-he was about fifteen years old-and I took turns carrying theblack bag; it was awfully heavy. But, I recall, we all showed good spirits. There was someeasy, casual conversation, turning mostly around the needs of the moment. But mainly,we were quiet, watching the road.Today, when Walter Benjamin is considered one of the century's leading scholars andcritics-today I am sometimes asked: VVhat did he say about the manuscript? Did hediscuss the contents? Did it develop a novel philosophical concept?Good God, I had my hands full steering my little group uphill; philosophy would haveto wait till the downward side of the mountain was reached. vVhat mattered now was tosave a few people from the Nazis; and here I was with this-dtis-/wmig/Ler Kauz, ce dri5lede rype-this curious eccentric. Old Benjamin: under no circumstances would he part withhis ballast, that black bag; we would have to drag the monster across the mountains.Now back to the steep vineyard. There was no path. We climbed between the vines talks,heavy with the ahnost ripe, dark and sweet Banyuls grapes. I remember it as an almostvertical incline; but such memories sometimes distort the geometry. Here, for the first andonly time, Benjamin faltered. More precisely, he tried, failed, and then gave fonnal noticethat this climb was beyond his capability. Jose and I took him between us; with his armson our shoulders, we dragged him and the bag up the hill. He breathed heavily, yet hemade no complaint, not even a sigh. He only kept squinting in the direction of the blackbag."

The sun had climbed high enough towarm us, so it must have been about four to five hours since we had started out. Wenibbled on the food I had brought in my musette, but nobody ate much. Our stomachs hadshrunk during the last months-first the concentration camps, then the chaotic retreat-fa pagaille, or The Total Chaos. A nation on the run, moving south; at our backs theempty villages and ghost tuwns-lifeless, soundless, till the rattling of the German tanksgulped up the stillness. But, again, that is another story, a very long one,VVhile we rested, I thought that this road across the mountains had turned out to belonger and more difficult than we could have guessed from the mayor's description. Onthe other hand, if one were familiar with the terrain and didn't carry anything, and werein good shape, it might really take considerably less time. Like all mountain people,Monsieur Azema's ideas of distance and time were elastic. How many hours were \"a fewhours\" to him?During the following winter months, when we did this border crossing sometimestwice or even three times a week, I often thought of Benjamin's self-discipline. I thought ofit when Mrs. R. started whining in the middle of the mountains: \" ... don't you have anapple for me ... I want an apple ... ,\" and when Fraulein Mueller had a sudden fit ofscreaming (\"acro-dementia,\" we called it); and when Dr. H, valued his fur coat more thanhis safety (and ours). But these again are different stories,Right now I was sitting somewhere high up in the Pyrenees, eating a piece of breadobtained with sham ration tickets, and Benj31Illn was requesting the tomatoes: \"WIdlyour kind permission, may I ... ?\" Good old Benjarnin and his Castilian court ceremony.Suddenly, I realized that what I had been gazing at drowsily was a skeleton, sunbleached. Perhaps a goat? Above us, in the southern blue sky, two large black birdscircled. Must be vultures-I wonder what they expect from us, ... How strange, Ithought; the usual me would not be so phlegmatic about skeletons and vultures.We gathered ourselves up and began trudging on. '\"The road now became reasonablystraight, ascending only slightly. Still, it was bumpy and, for Benj31nin, it must have beenstrenuous. He had been on his feet since seven o'clock, after all. His pace slowed downSome more and he paused a little langeI; but always in regular intervals, checking hiswatch. He seemed to be quite absorbed by the job of timing himself.TIlen we reached the peak. I had gone ahead and stopped to look around. The view cameon so sudden, for a moment it stnlck me like a fola morgana, Duwn there below, fromwhere we had come, the Mediterranean reappeared.

The encounter did not particularly surprise or impress me, since so many peoplewere trying to escape over the mountains.We passed a puddle. The water was greenish slimy and stank. Benjamin knelt down todrink.\"You can't drink this water,\" I said, \"it is filthy and surely contaminated.\" The water-bottle I had taken along was empty by now, but thus far he hadn't mentioned that he wasthirsty.\"I do apologize,\" Benjamin said, \"but I have no choice. If! do not drink, I might not beable to continue to the end.\" He bent his head down towards the puddle.\"Listen to me,\" I said. \"Will you please hold it for a moment and listen to me?

But you know all that .... I must go now, atif Wieder-SdWll ...\"For a moment, my eyes followed them as they were walking down the road. It's timenow for me to get out of here, I thought, and started to walk back. I walked on and felt:TIus isn't alien country any more, I am no stranger here, as I was only this morning. Italso surprised me that I was not tired. Everything felt light, I was weightless and so wasthe rest of the world. Benjamin and his companions must have made it by now. Howbeautiful it was up here!Within two hours I was back down in Banyttls. Nine hours uphill, two hours down.During the following months, by the time we were able to find our way blindfolded, weonce made it up to the border in two hours, and a few times in three to four hours. Thatwas when our \"freight\" was young, strong, in good form and, above all, disciplined. Ihave never seen these people again, but from time to time a name comes up and suddenlysomething clicks.

New orders, just received from Madrid: Nobody can enter Spain without theFrench exit visa.

Tosome, it also meant to get such things by \"collaborating.n For us, the apatndes) it wasprimarily a matter of staying out of concentration camps and escaping from the Gestapo.But Benjamin was no debrouillard ...In his remoteness, what counted was that his manuscript and he were out of the reachof the Gestapo. The crossing had exhausted him and he didn't believe that he could do itagain-he had told me so during our climb.

Benjamin first carne upon this text by Blanqui at the end of 1937.ConvolutesThe central portion of the manuscript of The Arcades Projeci (GS, vol. 5, pp. 79-989)consists of 426 loose sheets of yellowish paper, each folded in half to form a 14 X 22 em.folio, of which sides 1 and 3 are inscribed in Ber~jarnin's tiny handwriting, widl sides 2 and4 left blank. These folios are gathered into thirty-six sheafs (the German word Konvolulmeans \"sheaf\" or \"bundle\") in accordance with a set of themes keyed to the letters of thealphabet. The titles of the convolutes, as well as the numbering of the individual entries,derive from Benjamin. In regard to the ordering, the use of lowercase a (as in \"Ala,!\")denotes the third page of a folio. The letters without corresponding titles in the Overviewmay indicate that Ber~jamin plarmed further convolutes.In addition to Benjamin's cross-references (signaled with small squares) to rubrics ofdifferent convolutes, or to rubrics without convolutes, many of the citations and reflec-tions in the manuscript are marked with a system of thirty-two assorted symbols (squares,triangles, circles, vertical and horizontal crosses-in various inks and colors), which donot appear in the published text. The symbols are linked to papers that Benjamin en-trusted to Georges Bataille and that were discovered in the Bataille archive of the Bib-liotheque Nationale in 1981. These papers contain a detailed plan for the Baudelaire bookon which Benjamin was working in 1937-1938; the encoded items from the convolutes(more than 60 percent from Convolute J) are grouped there under a set of headingsrepresenting themes of the Baudelaire book as a whole. About half of the material wasthen further organized for the composition of the 1938 essay \"Das Paris des SecondEmpire bei Baudelaire\" (Ibe Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire).TIle convolutes were composed concurrently (rather tllan consecutively) in two stages:from the fall or winter of 1928 to the end of 1929, and from the begirming of 1934 untilMay 1940, The Gennan editor of the Passagen-Werk, Rolf Tiedemann, provides a morespecific dating of the entries on the basis of photocopies of manuscript pages made byBenjamin inJune 1935 and December 1937 (GS, vol. 5, p. 1262). Witltin a particularconvolute, the entries follow a roughly chronological order (some having been writtenearlier, then revised and b'ansferred to the manuscript of the convolutes).On the typographic differentiation between Benjamin's reflections and Benjamin'scitations in the \"Convolutes\" section, see the Translators' Foreword.A [Arcades, Magasins de Nouveautes, Sales Clerks]1.

There isno remark in the letters attesting to this. Adorno supports his position with twoentries from the Passagen-Werk itself (see Nl,10 and Nla,8), which can hardly beinterpreted in that way.

We may sUmllse that Horkheimer or Adorno referred Benjaminto the pages in question during the \"historical conversations\" in the fall of 1929. Thelibrary of the Institut mr Sozialforschung owned, at that time, a copy of the originaledition, and at least Horkheimer was wont to quote from scarce editions. This conjec-ture is corroborated when one checks the relevant passage in the first edition ofCapital: it deals with the definitive fommlations of commodity fetishism-that is, thevery concept whose \"unfolding\" would be \"the central core\" of the second Passagen-Werk sketch. Since the manuscript of the \"First Sketches\" was abandoned shortlyafter this entry, it is very possible that Benjamin's abandoning the manuscript mayhave been caused by the obstacles created by the suggestion that it was necessary forhim to read Capital. Finally, a letter from Adorno to Horkheimer ofJtme 8, 1935,which is absent from the fifth volume because it was made available only after theedition's publication, may well tum speculation into certainty. Adorno characterizesthe first expose as \"an attempt to unlock the nineteenth century as 'style' by means ofthe category of 'commodity as dialecticalunage!\" He adds: \"This concept owes asmuch to you as it is close to me (and as I have been beholden to it for many years). Inthat memorable conversation in the Hotel Carlton [in Frankfurt) which you, Ben-jamin, and I had about dialectical images, together with Asja Lacis and Gretel, it wasyou who claimed that feature of a historical image as central for the commodity; sincethat conversation, both Benjamin's and my thoughts on this matter have been reor-ganized in a decisive way.

    "text": "Benjamids in more than mere nuances. In his Kierkegaard book, Adorno equatedthe dialectical image with allegory, and later he also seems to liken it to phantasmago-ria (see N5,2, and 5:1136). Benjamin characterized Adorno's definition of the \"antin-omy of appearance and meaning\" as \"fundamental\" for both allegory andphantasmagoria, but he found it \"confusing\" in its application to the \"dialecticalimage\" (1:1174). The difference might be found in the cOlmection Bel~amin madebetween the dialectical image and elements of messianism-a cOlmection to whichAdorno, the more scrupulous Marxist, could not accede. One may try to put it thisway: the phantasmagorias of the arcade or the collector as such are not dialecticalimages in Benjamin's sense; both the arcades and the collector become dialecticallinages only when the historical materialist decip/u~rs them as phantasmagorias. But inBenjamin's opinion, the key that allows the historical materialist to unlock the coderemains connected to the discovery of a messianic force in history (see 1:1232).24. Marx, Capital, p. 20.25.
